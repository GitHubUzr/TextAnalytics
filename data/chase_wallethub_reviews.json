You\u2019ll receive a $100 initial bonus for spending at least $500 within the first three months of account opening, in addition to 2% back on Disney purchases as well as at gas stations, restaurants and grocery stores, plus 1% back on everything else. Your earning potential therefore depends on how much you spend in those bonus categories. Your ability to redeem your earnings, on the other hand, will depend on how often you make Disney purchases or indulge in air travel \u2014 your only two redemption options. Considering that lack of flexibility and the impressive value available elsewhere in the rewards-credit-card market, even ardent Disney fans may find a non-cobranded card to be more to their liking.

I deposited the check on 8\/9\/21 and Chase bank put a 9-day hold on it to make sure it would clear. I was actually grateful for that. I told the scammer that no car or money would be transferred until the check cleared.Nine days later, the check cleared and the money was legitimately in the bank. He had me send $8,400 to give to the \"shipper\". I sent the money to the shipper and scheduled the date for pickup. The day the car was supposed to get picked up I got an email saying the scammer's father, for whom he was purchasing the car, had died that day and could he have his money back. Fortunately I said no.ALMOST A WEEK LATER... on 8\/27\/21 I logged into my chase account to find every penny left in my checking account had been cleared out. I panicked thinking this guy had hacked my account somehow. It was worse...Chase had allowed TD Bank, (the bank that issued the check) to go back in and reclaim everything in my checking account.This was almost three weeks after I deposited the check AND NINE DAYS after the check had cleared!!What kind of bank let's their own customer's accounts just get cleared out long after a check has been cashed, had a hold on it, verified that it was okay and then three weeks later just lets another bank come in and take all the money left in the account?!DO NOT TRUST CHASE.

It seems that by policy your customers are responsible to catch the bank when a plan begins charging such service fees and to request that the bank change their plan to one that is appropriate and fair. \u00a0It also seems that if a bank customer fails to discover that the bank is charging them exorbitant fees associated with an inappropriate and unfair plan; then too bad for your customer.You asked for my opinion and there it is. \u00a0I give your bank representative 8 stars but I give only 2 stars to Chase Bank.'"},{"date":"2021-08-25","name":"Marlene","user_id":"missmkvan","verified":true,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"There are many ways to earn points through this credit card and shopping at your favorite department stores is one of them.

It\u2019s my everyday card because of the 1.5% cash back, and they made it even better by increasing to 3% on drugstores and dining. It\u2019s got a decent interest rate (but I try not to carry a balance on this card). I now have 3 Chase cards: Chase Freedom (with the rotating categories), Freedom Unlimited and now the Chase Sapphire. They serve different purposes in my wallet. The Freedom has the lowest interest rate so if I carry a balance it\u2019s on this card. The Freedom Unlimited is my everyday card, and now the Sapphire has travel benefits and no foreign transaction fee (but a REALLY high interest rate!) I will take the time to surf around my spending to get the best reward percentage out of each card. It does take a bit of effort but I can\u2019t stand NOT earning 3% back when I could be. And I always activate the \u201cChase Offers\u201d for places I might shop. You get an automatic statement credit, with a percentage or a flat $ back. A lot of reviews complain that they were not approved for the Unlimited card even with high credit. I had a different non-rewards Chase card that I never used because it didn\u2019t earn anything back. I called up Chase to ask if I could be upgraded to their Unlimited rewards card. Voila! The site and app is super easy to navigate, and I can easily see all my accounts at a glance.

We had already discussed which accounts needed to be addressed but he still made it difficult to make the payment and zero the balance to close the balance. He made it so difficult for me to make my payment and sent me home with a number that did not work that I closed all of my accounts with Chase.

The home lending advisor told us all of the good things that we wanted to hear with our mortgage and what our estimated costs will be. I was unemployed at the time (in May) so my wife and I added my father to our loan to help cover my missing income. We told them that he was recently retired as of late 2020 and they said it was fine and that his dividend \/ capital gains income will count. Turns out that was not the case and we only learned this about 3 weeks later because our first client care specialist disappeared and we had no contact for 3 weeks. We even called the original lender with no response. (we are now only 2 weeks out from the original closing date). At this point (early June) I returned to work so my income was included again but of course now my income won't offset my father's debts. They refused to remove him from the loan (citing chase policy) and had to start our loan process from scratch 2 weeks before closing. So the date had to be pushed back to July 9th which was within their 3 weeks chase closing guarantee. Throughout this entire process, I was given a whole bunch of empty promises and apologies of how they had given me wrong information but nothing no reassurances that they could take care of the matter in a timely fashion. I'm given a 2nd client care specialist who was unavailable more often than when she was present so I had to deal with her boss mostly and catch her up to speed about this long-winded process. Each day was this constant cycle of me saying \"is there any more information you need in order to get to closing\" they always said no we have everything we need (because all they did was look at my MyHome portal to see that I had no tasks). The next day there was always something else that they needed and the process was halted because they were waiting on said information. This stretched the process out until 7\/15 when we closed. But only learned the day before that Chase's estimates for closing costs were $7000 more than what they kept telling me. They had this information for months but never bothered to update the actual mortgage disclosure documents to reflect what my closing costs were actually going to be. Even when I asked about missing information all they did was read back to me the unfinished closing document. It also doesn't help that the point people who are supposed to guide me through this process knew as little as I did and only regurgitated what information is given to them by their \"specialist\" teams who can only be contacted by email??? Your own departments can't even contact each other by phone dragging out an already long and difficult process. I will never use Chase for any services after this awful awful experience."},{"date":"2021-07-19","name":"Herbert","user_id":"boxnam479","verified":true,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"Great rewards that are easy to use for airline tickets.

Like most everyone who applies for a points card, I did lots of homework on which is the best. I read all the glowing reviews of how great the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Ink cards are for travel points. I was especially convinced by the extra 25% in points value when travel is booked through the Chase Ultimate Rewards website. So I got both cards and my free 100,000 points and began charging everything on them paying 24.99% interest and annual fees to build those points. It's all a complete sham. When it came to booking my long awaited trip here's how it actually turned out: For the exact same dates and airlines, I compared the \"price\" at Chase Ultimate Rewards and Kayak. On Kayak I could book a flight from Salt Lake City to Johannesburg on Qatar Airways for $934. On Chase Ultimate Rewards it was $1,596.34 even with the 25% benefit. To be fair, I could have chosen the cheaper option on Turkish Airlines, which was the lowest priced option on Chase Ultimate Rewards. It was $1,584.94.So I charged up $26,795 and paid 24.99% interest for 2 years (=up to $13,392.14 interest)(depending on when you make your payments) + two $95 annual fees (=$180) (Total = up to $13,572.14) on the cards so I could get my \"free\" flight to South Africa.Still seem like a great deal?"},{"date":"2021-07-13","name":"sheabalee","user_id":"sheabalee","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"I disputed a charge with a moving company that I attempted to cancel with and they were avoiding my calls.

Chase\u2019s so-called customer service is abominable (it should be called customer disservice) and its handling of its depositors\u2019 money is extremely incompetent and sloppy, which is being generous.  It is my personal opinion that I have reason to at least question Chase\u2019s solvency and Chase\u2019s ability to meet its obligations to its customers.  I had two checking accounts, three credit cards, and a safe deposit box with Chase for many years.  To the best of my recollection, I never bounced a check or failed to pay my credit card balances in full each month on or before the due date.  Nonetheless, I received a letter from Chase stating that Chase had (past tense) cancelled all of my Chase credit cards, without any notice to me, at least seven days before I received Chase\u2019s letter.  The letter also informed me that Chase was cancelling my Chase checking accounts and my safe deposit box.  The letter failed to provide any reason whatsoever for Chase\u2019s draconian actions.  I made numerous calls and sent numerous letters to Chase to learn why Chase had canceled my accounts, but Chase has steadfastly refused to give me a reason for their bizarre cancellation.  The Chase staff at the branch I used was palpably shocked by Chase\u2019s cancellation of my accounts because I was an exemplary Chase customer.  The Chase staff made several calls to get the reason for Chase\u2019s cancellation of my accounts, but they could not get any information.  A couple of Chase\u2019s staff guessed that the cancellation of my accounts might have been caused by my long history of making large withdrawals from my checking accounts.  Hence, it is my personal opinion and belief that Chase might have cancelled my accounts because my frequent large withdrawals, if continued, could have exposed an insolvency problem at Chase and an inability of Chase to meet its obligations to its customers.  Moreover, it took Chase over a month to give me the interest that had been earned on my two cancelled checking accounts prior to Chase\u2019s closure of the accounts.  To make matters worse, I discovered that Chase made an unauthorized cash withdrawal from my company\u2019s checking account.  To the best of my recollection, I have never made a cash withdrawal from my company\u2019s account.  After spending numerous hours on the phone with Chase over two days, I finally got a copy of the withdrawal slip.  Neither the name of the account nor the account number on the withdrawal slip matched or even slightly resembled my company\u2019s name or account number.  Moreover, the signature on the withdrawal slip did not even slightly resemble any of the authorized signatures on my company\u2019s account.  Chase\u2019s payment of cash out of my company\u2019s account was inexcusably incompetent, and sloppy, and it resulted in another customer\u2019s banking information (account number and account name and account holder\u2019s signature) being shared with me.  I, personally, would not trust Chase with even one penny of my money because I, personally, believe that Chase might be insolvent and unable to meet its obligations to its customers and that Chase\u2019s handling of its customers\u2019 accounts is incompetent and sloppy.  It is my individual, personal, subjective opinion and belief, that Chase is incompetent, dishonest, and\/or unethical and might have insolvency problems and be unable to meet its obligations to its customers. \u00a0The foregoing review solely provides my individual, personal, subjective opinions, beliefs, and interpretations.  Any individuals who may view this review, or any part thereof, should examine the facts and issues for themselves and form their own individual, personal opinions, beliefs, and interpretations.

They communicate to you via letter but dont provide any method of communicating back. They provide a secure portal for communication however they limit you to roughly 10 choices of why you are communicating with them. If your need doesnt fit one of those choices they have you call in to their main customer service line. That customer service line asks for a debit card, credit card, or username. None of the choices I tried to use work. I have been transfered 5 or 6 different teams and each one has a hold queue and each one is the wrong team. The people internally have no idea how to route calls, what team is the right one to fit my request, and so far I have been on the line for more than 90 minutes and have yet to speak to someone in the right team.

If zero stars was an option, I would have chosen it! I was a victim of debit card fraud in the beginning of June 2021. I reported the card stolen or lost, cancelled the card and spoke with the representative to assist me in finding any other fraudulent charges. They returned the money stolen from me and then 2 weeks later they withdrew the money and denied my claim. Several specialist in the fraud department told me that my money is not protected by the FDIC and that it is my job to secure my account and prove the fraud. Amber, the fraud manager, explained the same thing. Amber told me that if it was a Chase Credit Card aka \"their money\" then Chase would do everything in their power to investigate the fraud, but if it's a Chase Debit Card aka \"my money\" it's my responsibility. Also, 3 charges went through after the card was \"cancelled\" or shut down. How was my pin compromised and how were 3 charges able to post on a card that shouldn't exist. Why was I not informed about these 3 charges when I initially reported the claim?  I asked if there were anymore charges and the representative said no. If he can't see them and they didn't post on my mobile banking app, then where did they come from if the card was already closed? Chase has blamed me multiple times. I was informed that because I am a victim of what I can imagine is fraud by an ATM skimmer, and they didn't make several attempts on the pin, that it is not fraud. Also, no one at Chase has heard of an ATM skimmer. The fact that they don't know what an ATM skimmer is, a device that had been reported in the news since 2016 and been around since 2010, is unacceptable. This is terrifying and seems illegal what they are doing. In my research I found that I am not alone. Thousands of stories from Chase customers have had similar issues with Chase THIS YEAR! One story came from a customer at my work, where I am the Manager of a big retail chain. He stated that he is having the same issue right now. I would never treat anyone the way I have been treated by Chase Bank and Amber the Fraud Manager. I have been yelled at, blamed, and hung up on. How is Chase the number one bank in America and why is my money not secured by the FDIC? I can now see why their rating is a 1.5. RUN away from Chase and remember to record all your calls with them. They will try to scam you."},{"date":"2021-06-22","name":"Mykcah","user_id":"mykcahg","verified":true,"product":"Chase Car Loans","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"They are the worst company to finance with customer service is a doozy.

I discovered this when I attempted to pay a credit card bill with the account, and alas, the transaction was denied by Chase with a reason code indicating my account was frozen. Another 1.5 hour phone call with 4 different Chase customer support representatives later, I was able to answer the 3 questions (Yes, 3 simple one word questions that were actually already asked in the first 1 hour conversation) to get my account unfrozen. NOTE: Nowhere on their website or in an letter\/email did they notify me that my account was in a frozen state. Additionally, Chase said they were unable to do anything about fees\/interest that were charged due to the failed payments, which I view as their fault based on the situation above.

On Kayak, I could get a flight for $80. On the chase booking engine, the same flight is available for $120... or 8000 points. See the problem? I'm also a fan of ultra low cost carriers like Spirit and Frontier, and they can't be booked with reward points. Or, if they can, it's so convoluted it isn't worth it.I like the Lyft Pink membership and hope it's a keeper past one year.

Chase claimed that I went into my bank account last Feb and changed it to a 12 month term, which makes no sense. Why would I change something that had been working fine for three years? The main reason I use auto-pay is so it is AUTOMATIC and I don\u2019t have to worry about it. To make a long story short, the auto-payments stopped, which I didn\u2019t realize until I saw my credit score drop like a rock because Chase reported it as delinquent (like after only one missed payment btw). I opened a dispute with the credit reporting agencies, the BBB and provided Chase with all the documentation they needed to verify my claim. Nothing changed. Big company stomps on consumer.

I have booked a flight with the representative, showed up to the airport at 6AM and they booked the flight but did not ticket it which means I did NOT have a flight back home. This is AFTER I had spent an hour with them on the phone confirming that I had these flights the day before.. I was on the phone with them at 6AM and the \u201cbest\u201d they could do was book it for 6 hours out... so they said they would open an investigation and reimburse me for my flight. Nothing happened. I couldn\u2019t even call and inquire because everyone (8\/10) are useless. 2. I have booked a flight with a credit from COVID and the representative told me that even though the flight credit was MORE than the flight I was rebooking the airline would reach out to me with a credit. That was a lie.. I called and they actually did open an investigation this time and \u201ccredit it back\u201d... if only it were that easy.. the credit I should have gotten back was $80 per passenger and I was told that I was upgraded on my previous flight and only had $30 left on my credit (Which again is 100% wrong because I did not upgrade or sit in an upgraded section).... at this point I don\u2019t even care how much money I lose and I cannot wait to never say the word \u201cchase\u201d again...

Of course I've, like many others, with another new fresh credit card, AND for Amazon. I've been finding and buying all those strange odd things there for EVERYTHING !!! It's through Chase bank, which I also have the Freedom, Freedom Unlimited, & Sapphire Preferred, and now the MIGHTY AMAZON. My SL was $8800 @ 17?? Apr. NOT sure what Chase's Modus Operandi (MO) is, with their HIGH APR's, but I pay it off in full each month !!! I keep a clean file with over $100k other credit lines. Like any credit card, If you don't PIF each month, you will pay high APR fees. So YMMV. Overall I use it strictly on Amazon, but it also has 2% at Gas stations. My other cards, some are categories, and unless gas stations aren't in those quarters category, this at least gets you 2%, vs. my normal regular 1.5% cards. So I've used it for gas also. Getting that extra .5% is at least like NOT paying sales tax. So I've been also using it there periodically too. Also, you WON'T be getting your accumulated 5% cash back until that current statement closes. So it'll be there NEXT month !!! I usually just leave it there, and purchase more AMAZON stuff next month !!! However, you can go to the website where it appears with my other cards, and can have the accumulated cash back sent directly to linked bank account. It's also a heavy all-steel type card, like my Chase Preferred card. It's a heavier weight card, NOT regular flimsy plastic, ordinary type credit card. This one's thicker, stronger than the same olds. Has all the security features it's supposed to have, #'s etched on the back, etc, Nice touch !!!

I don't usually write reviews but this was 'Unbelievable'. 1. I opened an account that is found to be invalid later on because my banker, Allan in Chase SD, didn't even try to contact me to via email or phone, when he sent me additional forms to my 'school address' where my account is, because he forgot to ask me to sign\/provide my ssn and w9 form. So my card was locked for days then weeks and i received a notice later on that my account will be closed because of that.2. Do you know the minimum waiting time for calling customer service specialist with chase? weekdays and weekends its never below 30 MINUTES. And you're lucky if you had that because I've always had to wait for 50 minutes only to be rushed and unheard of with my feedbacks atleast. Talk about great customer service.3. I am a student so I don't have a car yet. I had to walk to a chase branch near me. The nearest branch I went into, where I walked 20 minutes, don't even have a private banker to accommodate my situation, and was told that they won't be back \"probably\" in a month or so. \"probably\" is the word I really needed that day. So they directed me to another branch, which was another 20 minutes walk.. uphill. Great.4. In this other branch in Sunset Blvd., I was accommodated by a lady named Melissa(Chase,LA), who took care of the 2 forms for me, asked for my ids and had me signed the forms. Told me it was all clear and should be ready in a day or two days max. Good news, right? Only it wasn't. But is that really surprising? 3 days later, my account is still not activated and I called her with the number she once called me with the day after our transaction to assure me she will be \"in touch\". Guess what, 3 days after, I cannot reach her via text or call, and when I WAITED 50 MINS, ofcourse, for a customer service specialist(because I don't really wanna walk 40 mins again to Sunset Blvd Branch), I was informed that my account was CLOSED and CANNOT BE REOPENED. The only option I have is to go to a branch and open another account if I wanted to. What's the reason? Well, they(customer service) asked me if there was any erasures in the form or etc, because it was a mismatch and had to be closed. I told them why is that my fault when I only had to give my ssn and passport and sign with Melissa? Apparently, with this bank, you have no choice. So my checking is completely closed and instead of feeling like I had to go open another one, I am much more relieved that I won't have to deal with this bank EVER again. Right as this moment that I'm typing this, I'm in the middle of the 50 MINUTE WAITING TIME-CALL with a customer service to receive the balance in that checking account, WHICH I HIGHLY DOUBT WILL HAPPEN SMOOTHLY. Maybe. Maybe not.5. I just got done with the call after writing number 4. cool. Like I predicted, IT DOES NOT GO SMOOTHLY EVER WITH THIS BANK. I wanted them to mail the balance to my current address and not my school address but guess what? It's been already mailed and is considered invalid now with my call, but I still have to call them back in 10 days from now to be able to resend another check to my current address because it's their \"strict policy\" even though i'm literally telling them right now that I have a new address and provided all identification. No options with this bank. Talk about customer centric service. Lovely. Even at the end, they have me waiting WHICH I LOVE DOING because my time is so INVALUABLE. so call again for minimum 30-50 minutes waiting time call in 10 DAYS and only by then will they resend the check 7-10 BUSINESS DAYS. I love this bank so SO MUCH.Do I recommend this bank:ABSOLUTELY NOT. SAVE YOUR SELF FROM ALL THE HASSLE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. I WILL NEVER EVER USE THIS BANK, AS MUCH AS I CAN. That's it for my review, Time definitely NOT wasted."},{"date":"2021-04-30","name":"Dan","user_id":"dbe8813","verified":true,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"Honestly the worst for communication, they will make unilateral decisions due to algorithms their computers are running without any input from a real person.

We also wanted to take advantage of the 6mnth 0% interest last year so we asked for an increase which was denied, which is so odd because our income is more now than it was 6-7 years ago when we got our card and our credit scores have been about the same. Anywho, I asked for an increase today because we are going to Disney World next month and all they could do was $1,000. This is so very disappointing! I am looking to just close this account and not even worry about taking the credit hit just to open one worth our time and money, mind you our other 4 credit cards have limits of $8,000+ and even last years around the same time I call Disney chase, we upgraded our Southwest chase.

I paid for the same service twice already because that's what Chase representative told me to do as the very first thing. The support that I've got was so far below satisfactory level!

I have no 16digit card number yet so I had to keep choosing different options before I got to a live person. 2. First person I spoke with transferred me to signature visa and signature visa said oh chase customer service should be the one to help with that cuz it\u2019s their card. 3. Called again, and again since I have no card yet I have no 16 digit number yet so had to go thru all that hassle before getting live person. 4. Second person said ok u shall receive your card within a day or two via UPS. 5. I had to reach out again cuz I forgot to ask for tracking number. Third person said card was sent via USPS and u shall receive within 10 days. I said I was told it was expedited for me, then 4th person said yes it was sent rush and u shall receive within 2 days via UPS but there\u2019s no tracking. Go figured I did not receive it yet. And on top of that, right after the inquiry my score went down 21 points! My luck! No late payment and my utilization overall is 1%. Card not even reported as open yet. How could an inquiry ding your credit so much? I was expecting only 2 points decrease or maybe 5 points. I\u2019m giving it 3 stars for now for the generosity of bonus points and the flexibility of the card that you can use for travel or cash back.

Recently I had a major merchant dispute (>$2,000) and their customer service is hard to reach, unknowledgeable, and seem to leave no notes for their next colleague to take my next call. Worst of all, when it was resolved (in my favor) they never contacted me to notify me of that. 3. No customer service. If you can wait long enough to get through you will reach a rude unknowledgeable person who will likely drop that call transferring you. If you go online and post a message the only reply you get is to say that they're looking into it, that these things take time, and not to contact them again as it only delays them. their online messages are worded to infer that you're bothering them.

Customer service has gone down the tubes, they aren't friendly, they aren't helpful. I need a new card sent to me and they keep telling me I have to visit a branch to get a new card because of a \"security issue\" but they won't tell me what this security issue is or what type of \"proof\" I'm going to need at a branch to prove it's me when I get there. If I have to drive 4 hours I need to know this information up front! To top it off we called a branch like the customer support center suggested and they told us everything was fine and there was a new card on the way. Two weeks later there's no card and they're claiming they didn't send a new card and we have to go in. It's just going around in circles and no one will help at all.

Chase bank has really gone downhill as they lack the competence to perform basic banking functions, such as a wire transfer or knowledge of legal banking practices. Chase bank declined my wire transfer several times for no reason and then locked my checking account with no explanation. When I called them, they told me they closed my account for no reason and then refused to provide me with 5 years worth of my transaction history documentation, which is required by law in order for a bank to be FDIC insured. Then they froze my account funds for 10 days before mailing me a check, which still hasn't arrived, which is also illegal.

The bank has declined in customer service to the point where I made a choice to recently leave the bank. It wasn\u2019t until I left the bank that I released how archaic their policies and procedures really are and how they are fooling their customers.Here is a list of my experiences that forced me to look elsewhere.Overall Operations:-Chase corporate team is asleep at the wheel; they have no clue what is happening at the branches. Branch tellers are basically none existent with bank floor support kiosks 80% vacant on any given day-A teller once told me, \u201cour corporate team does not care what happens at the branches. Branch managers are powerless and have no information to help you\u2026we are only here to work the window.\u201d-I regularly received misinformation across representatives. What the 1-800 reps told me was different from what the bank personnel told me which was different from what the corporate offices told me. Sometimes this was as simple as when a internal bank transfer would clearBanking-Excessive balances must be maintained to avoid account fees, not friendly to students or lower income households-I had to carry around and manage multiple bank cards to do everyday functions\u2026way too complex-You need to be an information technology wizard to navigate and use their website or banking application-On a given Saturday (or other busy day) you can find 15+ people on line with 2-3 tellers behind the glass-Fees are everywhere you look, account minimums, withdrawals, transfers, and cashier checks and good luck trying to get them waived-Online tools are extremely limiting and trips to the branch with complex processes and approvals are a common occurrenceI\u2019ll leave you with this troubling fact: it took me 3 days and 6 trips to my local branch to close my 5 accounts at Chase\u2026\u2026.However, I opened up 5 new bank accounts, added all my payees and completed it all online IN ONLY 2 HOURS.

Today I asked one of chase representative to lower APR on my existing balance and they said we don't have any. We offer for new balance transfer. That's the answer I received for being a loyal customer to them for over 10 years. They could have done 0% on existing balance than customer would have stayed with them forever.

Everything proceeded smoothly and I had an account ready in a day. However, multiple problems occurred after this. First my account was locked over possible fraud because I tried to transfer money from my previous bank over via an external account transfer. I called Chase's support line and after approximately 2 hours holding I was told I needed to go into a local Chase branch with two forms of ID to unlock my account. Several days later I was able to do so, but now they told me they cannot unlock my account and had to call it in themselves. By this point both my checking and savings accounts had been deleted because my account was suspected of fraud. The branch representative said I then had to wait until their fraud department called me and verified who I was. So I waited several hours for this. Once that was done, I could return to the branch several days later to reopen a checking\/savings account and setup a credit card with automatic payment.For a month things proceeded smoothly and no issues arose. However, I then received an email and a call saying that my credit card was overdue even though I had personally ensured that automatic payments were setup the day before my balance was due. Upon examining my account online I found that automatic payments had been disabled and I now had to pay a late fee associated with the card and said card was deactivated until I paid the statement balance. I tried to make a payment for that day, but an error occurred when I did so. I could only make a payment at a later date even with more possible late fees pending.Summary:- Do not create a Chase account online, do it in person.- Do not use Chase phone support services, go to a local branch.- Do not rely on automatic payments for a credit card, pay the balance yourself.- All the Chase representatives I met were very helpful and kind, even though Chase's digital services were glitchy."},{"date":"2020-10-07","name":"Leslie","user_id":"detcity","verified":true,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"A large financial institution the staff treat you really great.

I had just under 3% revolving credit utilization, had no new inquiries for past 12 months, and was clear of the 5\/24 rule by just 1 card.This is by far the best rewards card with no annual fee ever offered by any credit card company so I made sure to have all my ducks in a row going in to the application process.Here are the benefits:-5% cash back on groceries on up to $12k for the first year..that is $600 in cash back for the first year-5% on rotating categories on up to $1500 in spending per quarter..almost the same categories as the discover it cash back rewards card but in different quarters. that is $300 in cash back assuming you max out each category-$200 welcome bonussoo we are at $1100 in cash back for the first year soo far.-3% back on dining-3% back at drugstores-5% back on Lyft-3 free months of DoorDash Dash Pass and 50% off the following 9 months...that is $45 for an entire year of dash pass($120 value)But this is just the beginning of the benefits. The Freedom Flex is one of a few zero annual fee cards that is the top tier World Elite Mastercard and the benefits through MasterCard are substantial. To name a few:-cell phone insurance(damaged or stolen) on up to $800 per claim.-Price Protection and Purchase Protection extended to 120 days.-An additional year added to your warranty on any item you purchase with 3 or less years-for every 5x lyft rides you take in one month, you get a $10 lyft credit once per month-and the list goes on and onThis card combines the benefits of the amex blue cash everday for the first year, the benefits of the SavorOne indefinitely, the  discover it cash back rewards card, and the original Freedom card. This is a no brainer"},{"date":"2020-10-03","name":"Alfredo Santos","user_id":"alfredosanto78","verified":true,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"As my Prime bank account I'm very PLEASED.

In the past the branch has notarized documents for us as a courtesy; so today when we needed a single signature witnessed by a notary in order to move $100,000 from a 401K to our Chase savings account, we headed to Chase.  The branch was virtually devoid of customers, and there was a notary present.  However, the person who greeted us told us Chase will only notarize Chase documents now.  I explained that the purpose of the notarization was to move $100,000 into our Chase account.  The person who greeted us did not allow us to talk to the notary, but kept running back and forth as intermediary.  He kept coming back stonefaced with a variety of excuses.  Finally he told us that the type of service we were asking for--witnessing a signature--involved \"too much liability\", and that was why it could not be performed.  All that was required was to look at my drivers license, look at my face, and watch me sign the document.   It took two minutes for the notary to do this for us at the UPS Store (for a fee).  The Chase branch certainly has our signatures and other information on file in case it wanted to further verify our identities. Apparently that is too much for Chase Bank to provide as a service to its own customers.

In sum, I created a new start-up last year and while opening a business checking account for it at my local Chase branch, a \u201crelationship banker\u201d seduced me into opening a Chase Ink Unlimited business credit card as well, via the promise of a $500 reward if I spent $3,000. I agreed, knowing that I\u2019d overextend my capital\/operational expenditures by a 1\/3 more than I could really afford or quite needed at that time, but thought I\u2019d be a fool not to get half of that overextension back in just a few months. After months went by with no reward, I contacted said banker to inquire as to why? Despite getting the credit for opening the account, he referred me to call the number on my card, noting it was my \u201csimplest option\u201d; gee, thanks for the personal customer service\u2026I then called customer service and it was a polite and sincere experience, to give credit where it\u2019s due. I explained my situation and asked what was wrong. In response, there was a pause and a slight gasp before she quietly replied that I had spent $2,996 and change, under $4 shy of the promotion. I repeated that I had overextended myself to get the offer and that my opening has been delayed due to the pandemic and asked, how could I be punished for such an insignificant amount after spending so much? Paraphrasing her engaging comments, she sadly and subtlety inferred (very clearly as if terrified to be overheard telling the truth to a customer) that she\u2019d clear me for the promo offer if she could, but that she\u2019d have to send a request for approval from some internal marketing\/promotions department. She then subtlety alluded that they were very tough\/unfavorable on customer decisions no matter the situation, but left me with some hope that, \u201cthey sometimes will just ask you to spend a few more dollars\u201d. Though she didn\u2019t sound very convincing I was touched by her genuine compassion. She knew what was right and wrong.    While waiting to hear back about my ruling, I scrutinized my records to see if I had made a mistake and eventually figured out that I had and by the $3 and change amount noted. I bring this up because ironically, my problem was that I inadvertently added in an expense from a personal credit card to my chase card accounting totals spreadsheet, with the real kicker being that this was because the Chase Ink card was delayed well past when my \u201cbanker\u201d said I\u2019d get it. The delay happened because the credit department had needed info that banker hadn\u2019t collected initially (not sure who was at fault). In short, while I do take responsibility for my $3+ error, I was in fact put in this situation because of a previous service failure at Chase Ink that caused a second failure in getting the card later than needed and being forced to use another card until then.A couple days later, I received a cold unsigned form letter from Chase, noting in a single generic sentence that I had been denied my $500 reward because I didn\u2019t spend enough. I was stunned that Chase could be so cruel for a measly 3 bucks and change. It\u2019s pure speculation, but from all my marketing experience, I have to assume said decision makers are incentivized to minimize costs, as any reasonable and decent human being couldn\u2019t be so inhumane otherwise, but I guess that\u2019s how JP Morgan & Co rolls. After being a good paying business customer that\u2019s spent thousands, I can\u2019t imagine a banker in person looking me in the face and denying a claim over $3.Though I doubt anyone in power will bother to read this, my final words are to the Marketing managers and Marketing\/Promotions department at Chase Ink that make these rules and decisions. In short, as a decades long professor and business practitioner, I say you all need to go back to school as well as grow some ethics and a conscious. You all may save Chase some money and perhaps hit a bonus\/target for yourselves up front, but at the cost of future business and the nontrivial ill-will that an action like this causes. Furious like any red-blooded American would be, I will share my experience with all who will listen and it\u2019s a pretty compelling evil corporate story that Chase Ink would treat a small business customer like garbage for spending $2,996.04 versus $3,000. Conversely, can you imagine all the good will and positive WOM marketing it would have created had I been able to brag about my relationship with Chase, boasting that you had done the right thing; my review would have been quite different. It\u2019s Marketing 101 and more profitable in the long run, beyond being the right thing to do\u2026 Moreover, treating a fledgling small business like this and especially given all the suffering from the current pandemic, it\u2019s simply unconscionable. That money could be the difference on whether I\u2019m able to stay afloat long enough to actually open to the public.

As soon as he did that they DROPPED his limit to $500 !!!! That's 10% of what he had. And again I state, never missed, never late, excellent credit.... So he called them and the lady couldn't really help so he said ok I've been loyal you just did me like that I'm done, I have other credit cards I don't want you no more. The lady became so rude he had to check her and out her in her place. ( He's a really nice guy so it was out of character she had to have been really rude ) He never really cared for the card for 1 reason anyway, every month he would get this charge on his card, it was almost $100 every month and it was from them. All it would say is... Transaction fee. He never figured out what it was. Mind you it's only supposed to be $99 a year. Anyway, just beware you may get approved and get a decent amount of credit line, but make sure you don't pay your bill on time, make sure you miss payments and make sure to never pay it off inadvertently gaining yourself bad credit if you want them to keep you.

I am being asked to use my credit by August 1, 2020, and that the trip must be completed by September 30, 2021. The original flight was from the US to the UK, through Aer Lingus, an Irish airline. This is completely unreasonable that I am asked to book a flight right now, while my state (California) has still not fully reopened, and most of Europe has travel bans against the US, or at the very least a 14-day quarantine upon arrival. Nobody is thinking about traveling internationally right now in the near future. I keep getting told that it's up to the airline to decide the policy, but it is Chase's job as the travel agent to advocate for its customers. Talking to a travel specialist online takes million years and the connection gets silent dropped sometimes, which makes me wait for half an hour before even realizing no one is on the other side, and I get reconnected to a different agent, and have to explain my situation all over again.

I booked a hotel through a third party company, Secret Escapes (SE), to visit Jamaica in late April. Due to Covid the hotel was closed during this time and my trip had to be cancelled. I tried to receive a refund from the company but they repeatedly stated that they act as a broker and that my contract is with the hotel. I confirmed with the hotel that they received no payment from SE and therefore SE is illegally holding my money for services they did not provide.After exhausting my options of trying to work directly with the company, I filed a dispute with Chase. Without contacting me or validating any of the facts provided by SE, Chase closed the dispute stating it was a valid charge because I had cancelled the trip. This was of course blatantly false. After calling multiple times (twice where I was hung up on mid-call), I was informed that in order to reopen the case I would have to either mail or fax a letter stating my request to reopen the dispute. In addition to the letter explaining the situation, I provided evidence of SE\u2019s terms and conditions stating that in the event a booking was cancelled by the hotel they would provide a refund and proof that SE did not pay the hotel. I tried faxing 3 times but the number they provided did not connect. I then mailed the documents. After no word for two weeks, I called to check on the status. I was told the documents had not been received and to call back in a couple days. I did so, having to wait on a long queue to get in touch with someone. Again I was told the documents had not been received and to call back in a couple days. I then went into a branch to talk to a representative directly. After 2 hours, they were able to fax the documents on my behalf. A week and another phone call later, Chase finally reopened the dispute.Two weeks later (and almost 3 months after the initial dispute was created) I received a response from Chase stating that while I may have a valid complaint with the merchant, this is not a billing error and concluded the charges were valid. However I was not claiming that this was a billing error, I was disputing on the grounds that this was a fraudulent charge for services not provided. Other credit card companies found similar cases with SE as fraud and returned the money to their customers. With the amount they charge for this card and the fact that it is supposed to be a travel card marketing perks of travel protection, I am less than impressed and will be looking for alternative options once my annual fee is up."},{"date":"2020-07-13","name":"Kelvin","user_id":"kelvint_14","verified":true,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"Assume card to have and customer service was great .

Chase for me, seems like they charge fee but they find positive solutions to help you waive the fee by enabling you to build good habit and save money. Every time I go to the bank, they are always professional and nice, or at least the person I had was great. Their app is very straightforward and helpful. I just like Chase, they're the most convenient and simple bank I had so far. In terms of credit card, I never could get accepted because I have zero credit which is reasonable.

We started getting reminders starting 5\/4 that my payment was overdue. As of 5\/7 BB&T put in a stop payment on that eCheck, but it seems Chase thought they'd posted it the same day!  But clearly it got cancelled, as they kept trying to post that and several other payments.  COVID has allowed any direct contact with either Chase or the Disney Visa folks with no direct communication available that would have resolved this instantly!On 5\/16\/2020 Chase finally realized there was a problem, and sent a RE-INSTATE AN ACCOUNT FOR ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS request.  We complied with all the required info FAXed to Chase the same day, including a replacement payment from another bank account. No acknowledgement of the completed steps were ever received.  Then we discovered that Chase had closed the account without calling or emailing us; instead a snail mail letter was sent that still has not arrived [5\/28\/2020].  Subsequent conversations with \"Chase Customer Service\" indicated that it looked like Chase had been using the wrong Bank Account number; also we were told that no managers were available.  Pretty strange for folks who have been big time customers for 15 years, through Disney managing the card and at least  2 different banks before Chase."},{"date":"2020-05-28","name":"Nancy","user_id":"nancyb_116","verified":true,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"I could not be more disgusted by my Chase credit card.

But trying to get a refund for an airline-cancelled flight has proven extremely difficult.  It took 2 weeks for Chase Travel to deny my request for a refund (I had to call 4 times, especially since they erroneously sent me emails meant for the airline in response to the airlines request for info).  They denied my refund on April 16th, saying that the airline had refused a refund and would only give credit.  So I checked the airline policies and it turns out they had publicly posted their policy on April 9th saying that I was eligible for a refund, which I had to request through my third party travel company.  So I called back first thing on April 17th to question Chase Travel's reasoning.  The first person said that I could only get a refund if I called the airline.  I explained multiple times that I didn't purchase from the airline, so the airline policy said the refund had to be issued by Chase Travel.  Finally, he transferred me to a manager because they said they had to check with the airline again and start the 2 week process all over again, and the manager had the ability to send emails.  After talking to the manager for awhile, the manager abruptly said, \"we'll give you a refund.\"  And I got an email from Chase Travel saying they were refunding me.  But that was in the morning on April 16th and as of the afternoon of May 5th, the refund has still not posted (though Chase Travel said it would take 10-12 days).  I'm tired of dealing with Chase Travel, who clearly tried to do all they could to try and get me to take credit over a refund.  So I called Chase Sapphire Reserve to dispute the charge from Chase Travel.  Chase Sapphire Reserve told me I had to call Chase Travel and there was nothing they could do (though I've already called Chase Travel 5 times).  Interestingly enough, a friend of mine had her flights cancelled and her non-Chase travel agency wanted to charge a $200 fee to process a refund, so she called Chase to dispute the charge for her airline tickets instead and she was given a full refund of the purchase price the next day.  So clearly, Chase has different policies if you are working with an non-affiliated travel agency.  This is so frustrating."},{"date":"2020-05-05","name":"fdittie","user_id":"fdittie","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"Chase is not customer friendly.

Obviously, no one is currently traveling and Canada has banned non-essential travel, so cancellation should have been easy.  During the Covid-19 epidemic, you cannot speak to a live person unless the travel is within 72 hours.  The idea that you cannot call your card services about anything seems a little unreasonable, but I understand these times are somewhat unprecedented.  As such, we cancelled through Chase on-line, as we cannot communicate with our card any other way, despite trying multiple different service related phone numbers.After submitting our cancellation of a reservation at the Fairmont Waterfront hotel in Vancouver, we wait several weeks to confirm the cancellation.  During that time, our friends that booked with the hotel called the hotel directly and received full refunds, even though they'd booked non-refundable rooms.  After several weeks, we receive an email from Chase Sapphire Reserve that says our hotel reservation was cancelled, but no refund of money or points would be given.  The email had a link to contest this decision.  We contested and waited several more weeks.  After two weeks, we get a response that says:\"we reviewed your request and ADVOCATED ON YOUR BEHALF WITH FAIRMONT WATERFRONT, but your travel dates are not covered by the latest waiver policy issued by the hotel.\"I immediately called the hotel and was informed the hotel was waiving any non-cancellation policy for any reservation through May 31, 2020.  This was the same policy applied to my friends' non-cancellation reservations that received a full refund.  I was told my credit card merely needed to call the hotel and ask, and a full refund would be given.So one of two things happened. 1) Chase never even asked for a refund or did not want me to get my points back, or 2) Chase obtained a refund from the hotel and pocketed the money and lied to me.Either way, I find this unacceptable, particularly from one of the more expensive and supposedly exclusive travel cards and programs.  I would take this up with Chase, but there is no one, anywhere, that I can contact with Chase."},{"date":"2020-04-13","name":"polocowboy250","user_id":"polocowboy250","verified":false,"product":"Chase Business Services","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"Chase is absolutely the WORST BANK IN THIS COUNTRY.

Unlike my other cards like Cap one I\u2019m able to transfer my cash back to actual cash back in the form of my Checkings account rather than applying it all to my account as some sort of credit. Payments were swift and easy, and instantly credited to my card. No usual 3 day wait times. This card reports on time to the credit bureaus, the same way I pay my bills on time, so I respect that. Not all card companies are made equal, and Chase is the best and most well rounded that I have in my wallet right now. I can\u2019t say that I can rely on every card company I have right now, or that I trust every card company I have right now. EXCEPT chase. The only reason this card falls short of being my primary card is that the rewards rate is just 1.5% and I have a card that gives me 2% flat on everything.

They wouldn't budge on removing the fee or working with us. Their customer service was lacking, especially with the way they rotate their agents with every response I sent them. It's a very subtle, abusive policy. If you are smart with your money management, I would suggest going with an honest company."},{"date":"2020-03-20","name":"Bob","user_id":"bobc_12","verified":true,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"This is used mainly for gas and groceries which is the majority of my purchases.

First they denied receiving my claim, and when they were called out on that dishonesty, they demanded I produce the original receipt, even though I provided a duplicate receipt from Best Buy.  When I escalated that issue, they dropped that demand, and then  refused to accept the warranty info that I forwarded to them from the TV manufacturer, requiring instead that I provide them with the 140 page user manual.   They are now insisting in more documentation, and when I asked a supervisor why I wasn't told at the beginning why the info I provided was insufficient, I was met with hostility and derision.   It's clear that their tactics are designed to force you to give up on your claim,.

I am selling my home and my buyers are using chase thinking chase is a big bank, good rate etc. So 31 days into escrow, they still couldn't get the loan approval. All they tell us is they will get it done tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow. As a seller, I am purchasing another home which has been waiting for the fund from my old home to new home. Fees and fine from the delay were kicking it since chase has delayed the buyer's loan and we ended up paying tons of fee. They originally promised 15 days but they were so far off from the deadline.

I called and they reviewed the pay off call and will not remove the ding as they did not make an error.

As I said, we use auto pay to avoid these issues and we use paperless so we were not getting notified of the issue.  So we called to get it straightened out, and at the end of that call it was.  Or at least we thought, but as it turns out, nothing was fixed.  And now after a second call, they refuse to fix it and remove the late fees, even though the mistake is theirs.

Since this one said I would recieve a letter in the mail after the application I was pretty positive that I had been denied,  however about 10 days later the card and paperwork arrived in the mail.  Approved for $8500. Scores were between 750 and 760 respectively through the 3 bureaus. This card does have an annual fee but if you travel a good bit then the card actually pays for itself.  They offered a sign on bonus of 60000 miles(points) if I spent 4000$ in 90 days. I did not put myself in debt to get the bonus so instead of shopping to meet the bonus guidelines,  I used it to pay my property taxes. So I've spent it and paid it and I see the 60,000 pts will be on my next statement. A few things that weren't my favorites:This card does NOT give a time of 0 apr and has a very high rate. Also, the yearly fee was billed the first month. So your paying before you even use it.  Overall,  JPMC gave me my second highest cl and has AMAZING travel features among other things.  I do travel enough to offset that annual fee,  but if you're someone who doesn't maybe it would be better for you to take the more affordable Chase Freedom instead of the Sapphire.

EVEN. CLOSE.; (2) your TransUnion score IS one of your THREE FICO scores (Chase uses principally Experian, then TransUnion, in the Northeast)... TO BE SUCCESSFUL with Chase you need to ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM FIRST, as in, for example, SETTING UP A CHECKING ACCOUNT.... Yes Chase IS more difficult to obtain, but not THAT much... Last December I opened a Checking Account with the intention of applying for a CC after a few months (I added Direct Deposit from my job to the account)... and at the end of my Checking application, I saw a Credit Card application icon at the bottom, and i was invited to apply for their card, and, BOOM i was ACCEPTED!!  And I only had FICO scores in the LOW TO MID 600'S on all three agencies, and only a Capital One Credit Card with a sorry $300 line!  So, yes, they WILL accept you, but will start you with a very low line (mine was $500), but after 6 months or so of perfect payments, you should start to see additional offers for other cards or an increase in your credit line (they sent me invitations to apply for one of their higher end cards)...

Chase offers this card in a way that any reasonable person would assume it's a good option to transfer over balances from other cards and get a free short term loan as a result.  As can be seen in numerous reviews, and I have now experienced first-hand, they will only approve you with a low spending limit.  I have exceptional credit, house is paid off, no car loans, over $600k in assets, etc.  I have a few other cards with limits in the $15k to $20k, so I was expecting the Chase card would be approved for the same.  Nope.  They gave me a $5000 limit.  Based on other reviews it seems like this is actually a high number compared to others.  I was only even applying for this card as a very short term solution to some credit card debt I wanted to wait a few months to pay off.  Now I've taken a hard pull on my credit report for a credit card with a limit that is far below what would reasonably be expected.  The ability for anyone to get approved with a high enough limit to actually utilize a balance transfer up to $15k that they advertise is a fantasy.  For anyone with good credit, I would recommend just getting an unsecured personal loan from Lightstream instead.  Yes, you will be paying interest, but it's a very low rate and at least the terms are clear and they aren't just playing games with you like Chase."},{"date":"2020-04-06","name":"Gerald","user_id":"geraldw_69","verified":false,"product":null,"review_comment":true,"stars":0,"review":"Thanks for the candor.

So to add insult to injury I was now going to crash my credit score because I couldn\u2019t make any payments on my cards. When I called Chase a real person answered right away and was very kind very understanding and talk me through everything that only that but I didn\u2019t realize I had another credit card with them through a store department store credit cards I had taken out a while back and I don\u2019t think I used it maybe once.

They've started charging overdraft fees out of nowhere. If an overdraft occurs on your account but you head to the ATM and pay it before a fee occurs, youve satisfied that balance right? Wrong! According to chase representatives their system takes time to update and even though the account has a positive balance, they still overdraft for a $35 fee and it's not a one time fee it's a reoccurring fee. Yes you get charged daily!!! For the same charge.  I'm switching! Chase is flat out stealing from their customers and the representatives are clueless as to how to solve the problem they just keep reading whatever script they rehearsed at the time of training for hire to deal with you and its annoying and frustrating. The best bank to go to HANDS DOWN is BANK OF AMERICA I've had an account with them about the same amount of time as chase and have NEVER had a problem.  When they were talking on the news about Banks profiting off of charging customers ridiculous overdraft fees believe me you they were talking about JP Morgan SPECIFICALLY. From someone with experience take my advice bypass Chase Bank. The \"bonus\" they claim to give you when you sign up will be taken back through fees.

Try to imagine anyway your use of credit might temporarily go up significantly (on any credit cards), such as for finishing a home improvement project before refinancing your house, or for the cost of repairs before trying to sell a car or your house. Chase will reduce your credit limit without any email, text, or phone call warning you.  Chase will even freeze your card late one night while you are traveling; right when you have to change a flight; or if you have to extend a hotel stay for a week on a business or mission trip; or when you must rent another car because of a missed flight or an extended trip -- again without any email, text, or phone call warning you.  If cancer strikes a loved one, and your bills temporarily mount up, Chase will be the first credit card company to cut your Credit Limit severely, with no warning even if you have never been late on a payment, and even if you have home equity enough to draw on to cover those increased bills.  After doing all of the above, with no remedy to you, Chase will also be the LAST credit card company to restore your Credit Limit, and the last to restore to you the privilege to make Balance Transfers to pay off higher interest credit card debt with low promotional offers from Chase. BUT, if you do get to utilize a Balance Transfer Offer, Chase service people tell you \"any amount paid over your Minimum Balance Due will go toward all your higher interest purchases first, and then toward our promotional balance,\" which sounds optimal, but Chase people don't tell you that if you charge $4,000 in purchases in a month, AND you then make a $4,000 payment RIGHT AFTER those charges post to your account, so you don't forget or spend that cash elsewhere, Chase will apply the $4,000 toward your 0% promotional balance, and then begin charging you interest on the purchases you made for the month even though you paid them off as soon as they posted to your account.  Will they correct this?  Heck No!   American Express, Citibank, Discover, US Bank MasterCard, etc. have never pulled any of this crap on me, but Chase did and Chase is the card I've had the longest.  \"The customer is always right,\" means nothing to Chase, nor does customer loyalty."},{"date":"2018-11-01","name":"Devlin English","user_id":"devline","verified":true,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"Look... you Pay it off and they tell the Credit Bureaus ....

CHASE is a no-nonsense bank with accounts that pay low interest and will sock you with high monthly fees unless you follow the rules. It is a bank for everyday transactions-pay in, bills out. If you want to earn 10%+ on your deposits, look elsewhere. 11 years ago I had to break a 6-month term CD with them (for a mortgage deposit)-they charged me the full $3k penalty; I complained loudly but there was no exception, no nonsense. Without parallel, CHASE is the best walk-in brick'n'mortar bank I have recently used. Like Citizens Bank, Santander, BoA, and others, it has great sign-up promos-use them (have to keep the a\/cs open for 6 months). In the 3 times I have signed up with CHASE in VA, IL, and CA, it was with very knowlegable and competent female reps. I've had no problem with the CHASE online services, including QuickPay, and currently have my pay direct-deposited and use their online bill pay. There are no brick branches here in south NJ, so I drove 40 minutes up to Trenton for some counter checks and then to close the CHASE accounts. On this Saturday morning, the branch manager, Chelsie Medina, was quietly and efficiently processing the Spanish-speaking and English-speaking customers on a first-come basis. It was impressive to watch. When my turn came, she helped me out quickly without needless small talk and suggested a cheaper money ordaer alternative for one amount. She also indicated that south NJ would get a branch at Cherry Hill in a few months time. Because of this news, and her impressive efficiency, I am holding back shutting down my CHASE accounts and moving my (working) $20k balance elsewhere.

They have a functional mobile app, online banking, mobile deposits, and deposit-friendly ATMs.  Most importantly, Chase is found in most parts of the US, so there's not a problem when I'm traveling and need a fee-free Chase ATM.  I have yet to understand why people provide low ratings\/reviews because Chase charged them an overdraft fee.  This is the norm for ALL banks in the US.  This isn't anything new.  Big national banks, small local banks, and credit unions all charge various fees like this.  Yes these fees can seem unfair at times, but if you make the decision to use a financial institution to hold your money, then both parties (you and the bank) are expected to the follow the agreed upon terms and conditions.Also, just a bit of advice for the ones that do not have direct deposit and\/or can't financially maintain $1500 daily balance per month to avoid Chase's $12 monthly maintenance fee, I would suggest you find a local bank or credit union that typically has a free checking account with no minimum balance.  You could also try an online bank if you do not regularly deposit cash.  You may lose the convenience of having a Chase ATM or branch almost on every corner, but I'm sure will save more money in the long run by getting a totally free checking with a local bank or credit union.Overall, I hate to see people bash Chase because they can't seem to have a handle on their finances to avoid the many fees that are disclosed in writing upon opening your account, as well as publicly posted on Chase's website.  This actually goes for pretty much all banks and financial institutions.  Ultimately, it's all business...  And yes, I have been charged overdraft fees in the past, and I also incurred those fees due to not properly tracking my finances and spending.  Not once did I blame the bank for my lack of monitoring\/planning.  I now am simply more responsible and monitor my finances to prevent the banks from making money off of me."},{"date":"2016-09-09","name":"HOWARD PAUL SHORE","user_id":"howard pauls","verified":false,"product":"Chase Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I Just Received Great, Outstanding Service From Johana Gabriel!Back on Thursday, September 8, 2016, I was out in the Long Beach area and needed to get to a bank and luckily just by using my google app, I was able to find the closest branch to where I was which was just a few short blocks away located at:  940 Long Beach Boulevard, Long Beach, California  90813-4420  (562) 951-1315.I was received and greeted by Johana Gabriel who is a Qualified Personal Banker who took really good care of ME as her customer by sitting me down at her desk and taking my banking deposit as well as helping me to get verified for the United Airlines Mileage Plus Credit Card which operates under the Chase Bank and helping me to find out about getting my Credit Line Increase for the Chase Freedom Unlimited Card, including setting up my Chase Freedom Unlimited Card to be able to debit my checking account in order to pay the bill in full each and every month so that I am Never Late In Making A Payment.All of the work and tasks performed by Johana Gabriel were done with patience, kindness, diligence, respect and I was Not Feeling Rushed, nor Pressured as well.I more than Highly Recommend Johana Gabriel to anyone seeking out Only The Best In Chase Banking Services.Thank you very much Johana Gabriel for your time that You had spent with me on that day!Sincerely yours,Howard Paul ShoreLoyal Chase Bank Customer For Over 10 Years\/HPS"},{"date":"2016-07-14","name":"dvelazquez07_88","user_id":"dvelazquez07_88","verified":false,"product":"Chase Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I recently opened my chase bank account, and I must say that it was a breeze.

Which from what I understood by now that you'll get only when you buy your second order, you can use that 30$ card later not an \"\"INSTANT\"\" off as they mislead you.My concern is why is misleading language used on checkouts. Why is that \"\"INSTANT\"\" off. And I really don't want this card now. You can keep it. I contacted Chase but they say they don't cancel once applied.They even had a hard inquiry on my credit score which effects my score badly. I am really really not satisfied with this way. Please stop misleading and let me know how do I cancel my Visa card application without my Credit score being effected. And When I call Amazon care they say Chase will give 30$ off. Chase say they don't do it, Amazon pays you gift card. What a fraud.  They won't cancel your card, won't give you off. What a poor way of earning money and business. I'd rather stick to other online stores.

Over the last 12 years I have never had a bad experience with the savings account, although the $5 fee and minimum balance required to avoid it could be a hassle to some people.  In order to avoid this it is very easy to set up a monthly recurring deposit of $25.  Because it is easy to go online either at home or on your phone and transfer money between your savings and checking, you don't necessarily need to keep that $25 in your savings account.  Their website is very intuitive and the online savings app only takes 3 clicks after signing in to transfer money back and forth from your savings to checking, or vice versa.

I called customer service to inquire about the fee and after politely asking if she could waive those fees taking into account that I've been a customer since 1998 and with two Chase credit cards on my name, the representative flatly stated the she couldn't waive the fees because they were legitimate.

Both cards build your credit.  Both cards are good for anything Amazon offers up to your credit limit.  For someone seeking to raise their credit score, I recommend the Revolving Credit card and a few purchases paid off in two or three months time.  That will boost your credit without tempting you into Cash Advances or Groceries, which the Visa is capable of doing.

The second my promotional period was over, they reduced my credit limit without notice, thereby making my credit to debt ratio worse and hurting my overall credit rating, regardless of the fact that I was current on my payments on all my accounts (Chase or otherwise). I didn't know that this had happened, and, thinking that I had at least $1500 available credit, I was caught off guard when I went to make a purchase and my card was denied. Additionally, even though my promotional balance was paid long ago, they still charge me interest on the purchase balance that was not paid before the end of the promotional period. On top of that, my husband has two slate cards, and they somehow are regularly compromised. In the last three years, he has had to have 5 replacement cards sent. Also, Chase had been charging him for years for their account protection service which they never informed him that he was enrolled. On top of that, they screwed up their legal obligation to handle his accounts according to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (Yes, Chase, you can't even get it right for those who fight for your right to be idiots). Needless to say, Chase has cost my family thousands of dollars, diminished credit scores, and a lot of stress and  unhappiness. Their card sucks. Their customer service sucks. Their entire attitude sucks. The 0% APR and 0% Balance Transfer Fee isn't worth the hassle if anything unexpected happens in your life and you have to handle something dire and reduce your payments for a couple of months (and I am sure I am not the only one in the world who had to burn through their emergency funds - almost 2 years worth of pay set aside -, stop contributing to their retirement funds, and go a little too much into debt because of health or other emergency issues).

For example, since I charge everything each month to my one card I usually have quite a balance. But I pay it off in full to avoid any late fees and interest spikes. Each time I pay my card, I get what is called \"Chase Rewards\" points. In fact just for signing up, there was a special $100 offer after I think I spend $500 or so in the first 3 months. It was great. So that money got instantly credited to my card and I can use it to pay off a part of a bill or I can use the money to purchase things on Amazon. It's pretty cool. Overall I have earned a couple hundred \"free\" dollars which is awesome. If you have to spend the money anyway you might as well get something for it. I love that there's no annual fee too.

There are no fees associated with the card, so as someone who pays my balance in full every month, I don't pay a dime to use the card. Over the years, I've only had to call customer service a handful of times, and they've always been very helpful. I like that I can schedule as many payments per month as I want, and don't have to wait for a billing cycle to end if I want to pay something off a little early.

Chase was offering a $125 credit for opening a Total Checking account. The coupon was very detailed in describing the terms of the credit agreement. Additionally, Chase was very clear about the requirements of the checking account, such as keep a monthly minimum of $1500 in the account, or having at least $500 direct deposited in the checking account to avoid the $12 monthly service fee.

The best thing about it is that it is always easy to find a Chase ATM location nearby and the people who work there are friendly and helpful.  However, one of the major drawbacks of this account is the heavy fee they charge you if you do not meet their monthly requirements for an account balance.  This was difficult for me when I was in college because money was tight and I did not have a job giving me direct deposits so that I could get around Chase's monthly balance requirement.  I think the fee is expensive and ridiculous because they are essentially charging you to use your own money.  So if you are low on cash, or in college, or do not have a job with direct deposit, then be vary wary about the extra fees that Chase can add on by you having a checking account.

If I do pay a fee, it's because I get a great benefit from the card, and I don't see how that's possible with this card. I suppose if you are spending a lot of money per month on the card, you'd get a decent amount of points that could be redeemed, but I typically shy away from the gimmicks of points, etc. Card companies can always change the terms of these programs and I've been burned.

Even if you don't travel often, this is a good card to consider having because if you work the card for the points, for example use it at restaurants, and spend $2,500\/year eating out (approximately $200\/month which if you have a family isn't unreasonable) that will give you one free room in addition to your anniversary room. If you spend $5,000 over the course of the year on other items, then you have three free rooms and can make a mini-vacation out of it. Hotels in the NY metro area are expensive and where I live in NJ, a Hyatt room can go for close to $200\/night. So the room benefits are definitely useful. The downside on this card is the interest rate and annual fee. If you pay the card off in full each month, you'll avoid the 16% interest rate, but for many people that is impossible. The other downside is the $75 annual fee. American Express charges a similar annual fee, but they have many more opportunities for earning points and you have to pay the full balance at the end of every month so you aren't stuck with a looming interest-accruing balance.

One of the requirements is having at least $300 in the account or have at least one automatic transfer per month into the account. If you do not meet these requirements there is a $25 fee per month till you do.

I have received calls within the hour of there being  questionable transactions and if I approve of them or not.

Overall pros: Great customer service, high credit limits, good rewards program, chip embedded card is convenient for certain scannersCons: Annual fee. The chase freedom card could be a good suggestion if you don't spend the necessary amount of money every year to consider the annual fee to be negligible. Verdict: It's 4 stars to the average consumer who uses the card for groceries and personal items because the annual fee is too much.

In 2005, shortly after unexpectedly losing my first job, they stacked the order of my checking account purchases in such as way as to cause the maximum number of overdraft fees when my balance ran into the negative (i.e. if a $0.50 pack of gum, a $2.00 comb and $20.00 worth of gas were purchased, they would deliberately rearrange the payment times so that the largest amount got withdrawn first, so that the maximum number of overdraft fees charges would be incurred). At first, I though it was my own poor luck but then, years later, I was notified of a class action settlement in which Chase was determined to have done this deliberately (and illegally) to THOUSANDS of customers.

However, if you are a frequent traveler or a big spender, the earning potential as well as the up front bonus of 40,000 points can make it a great card. Furthermore, the lack of foreign transaction fees also is great for the frequent traveler. Finally, if you are someone who carries a balance on your card the APY is a decent option.

The initial bonuses available are particularly appealing, specifically the $100 bonus if you spend at least $500 on the card in your first three months. The long-term rewards, set at 1% of all purchases and 5% of a rotating category, are quite appealing. These are nearly identical to the rewards offered by my Discover card, which I currently use. It's a great system and the 5% reward rate adds up quickly, especially when the category includes all major grocery stores like it currently does. With potential for the APR to be as low as 13.99%, this is quite a solid deal for a credit card.

You have your typical fees like you would on any card, but they are very reasonable. What makes this card special is how quickly you can accumulate the points and the variety of things you can spend them on. Let\u2019s look at a few Pros of this card.Pros:- If you spend $2,000 within the first three months of owning the card, you get a bonus of 50,000 points right off the bat. That\u2019s enough alone for a vacation right off the bat. It practically pays for itself immediately. It\u2019s quite an impressive offer.- Point redemption isn\u2019t limited to just flights. You can use them toward car rentals, cruises, hotels, and several other carrier flights.- You can get gift cards using the points. That\u2019s right, you can get gift cards using these points. How many other airline cards let you do that? That alone is a huge plus for me and enough to earn its own bullet point.- No earn or redemption limit on points. Some cards will only let you store a certain amount of points at a time rather than let them accumulate. What\u2019s worse is some cards actually have points that expire, which is just plain ridiculous and unfair. If I get cash back that never expires, so why should my points? Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Premier Credit Card gets it.- No over limit fees is another great feature of this card. Most cards will try to squeeze every penny they can from you, but this card has a little forgiveness. Be warned, you will have to pay a fee if you tell them you\u2019re going to purposely go over the limit.- Reasonable late fees in the form of tiered late fees. Depending how much you owe from your bill you can owe a different amount of late fees. For example, if you owe $100 in late fees, then you will owe them $15. The max late fee you can owe is $35.- No foreign transaction fee is probably the one feature every airline card should offer. You are going to be traveling and they want you to travel. They even offer two points per dollar when you buy from them. Why would any airline card try to prevent you from spending money while overseas?All of these features sound great, but there\u2019s some that might be a kick in the rear for some people.Cons:- Excellent credit is needed, so they\u2019re very picky about who they\u2019ll hand this card out to. They do like to force it upon you at the airport, though.- An annual fee of $99 can be a deal breaker for a lot of people. It seems to be one from a lot of the comments I\u2019ve read.Final VerdictAs you can see, there weren\u2019t many cons since the APR of 15.99% is standard. All of the comments I\u2019ve seen indicate the card has great customer service and you receive your points very quickly. Others and I would consider this can excellent card and one everybody should consider."},{"date":"2015-01-15","name":"Sara Baker","user_id":"AdvantageSales","verified":false,"product":"Chase Savings & CDs","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"The Chase savings account I have is the most convenient and helpful one for me.

While we all know that credit cards are bad for us, at least a regular card does not rip you for monthly fees!  Not so here.  While they generously allow some free fees, as shown above, I note that it's a $4.95 monthly fee and a $2 ATM transaction fee.  So let's say you use this card for one year, and, conservatively, use an ATM twice per month.  That bumps your monthly fee to $8.95.  Use that for a year and you've dropped a whopping $107.40!  I don't know about you, but to me, that is real money, folks.  It is absolutely not worth it, at all.  Why does the Chase Liquid Prepaid Card deserve that much of your hard-earned money?  I do not believe they deserve it.  They say they will waive the fees if you add your checking - OK - seems fair enough, right?  Maybe, but if you have a checking account, I do not believe you need their prepaid product at all.  In that case simply use your debit card.  This type of product makes me very angry.

First off while the bonuses seem generous many of these are not very useful for your average person, especially ones such as myself who tends not to travel very much.  As an improvement I would suggest adding in some additional rewards, perhaps some applicable to a sedentary individual.  Vouchers for restaurants and alike would be nice.  The second issue I take it at the point system seems very convoluted at first glance, and a bit of clarification in this regard would be very useful to me and I'm sure other people.  While I'm not sure there's much to be done about this aspect, the high credit rating required to obtain this card could be prohibitive to some, and if there's any flexibility in this regard it would be welcome.  As far as the positives go, for a traveling man this card would be inordinately useful, especially in regard to the nice hotels it offers and a generous rewards related to travel.

It offers good rewards compared to most cards, matching reward points and airline mile benefits extremely well. However, I feel these good qualities are outweighed by the exorbitant APR and Cash Advance rates (15.99% and 19.24% respectively). Both of these percentage rates are extremely high, and often are found on cards given to people with poor credit. However, the poor credit crowd is not the target of the card, given the upper limit of the amount needed to achieve bonuses (for instance, $2000 in the first three months to earn a good amount of bonus airline miles).

First, it's one of the best cards for building points that can be converted into United Airlines points (among other airlines), and Hyatt Gold Passport points (among other hotels).  Second, it is a way to be able to convert points earned by the Chase Freedom card, which has rolling 5x category bonuses, into Chase Rewards points.  Most people these points as worth anywhere from 1.5 cents to 2 cents, which is more valuable than if you were to redeem the points for cash at 1 cent a piece.

After signing up the rewards, all I have to do is go to participating restaurants and grocery stores and make a purchase. I am able to save on fuel at any Shell gas station. The one drawback of that though is that I have to pay gas at Shell and there may not be a Shell gas station everywhere. Although this is the only drawback of the MasterCard, I would give it more consideration in comparison to Amazon when looking at the ongoing rates. Amazon\u2019s ongoing rate is 14.24% - 22.24% while for the Upromise MasterCard the ongoing rate is 12.99 or 20.99%.

So I waited and waited and I never saw my balance transfer.  I called Chase to ask what the status was and THEN they tell me that they denied the transfer because it was a business line of credit.

I tried speaking to a manager and explain how unfair this all was.

Some of the reasons are my own doing and some of them are from Chase's policies.  I, like many Americans in today's day and age do not make enough money to make ends meet or live the way I want to live etc.  Chase has a policy on this Checking account regarding the overdraft policy.  They will approve the overdraft's several times to where each time you receive a fee of $34 plus what the total purchase was.  This policy was good for me at first because it helped get me through from one paycheck to another.  However, after time, I ended up abusing to the point where by the time I received each paycheck through direct deposit, my account was already negative 200 or 300 dollars.  Chase will allow the overdraft up to 4 to 5 times or more, depending on if you have direct deposit or not.  In addition to the $34 fee everytime the account allows you to overdraft, every 5 days they slap you with an additional $15 fee for having a negative balance.  Unfortunately, due to this overdraft policy from Chase it got so bad that when my paycheck was deposited, I wasn't going to have any paycheck left so I had to direct my deposit to another account and now my Chase account is overdrawn by several hundred dollars.

I started using it exclusively with Amazon purchases because of the points you earn and the majority of things, besides food and gas, are bought through Amazon. It is very easy to use your rewards. The best is the ability to just apply your points as a credit on your next statement. I also like the ability to pay for new Amazon purchase just using the rewards you have already earned right as you check on on Amazon. Once i saw the rewards stacking up, i started using this card as my every day card, putting all my purchases on it since any purchase earns you at least 1 point, gas earns you 2, and amazon purchases earn you 3. So far I have had my amazon card for about 4 years and plan to continue using it for years to come. I would highly suggest this care to anyone, especially students who are looking to save money. You can generally find anything you need on Amazon anyways and the prices are usually better than anything you can find in stores. So you save money and earn money at the same time.

They say you earn a $100 Bonus after you spend $500 on purchases in your first 3 months from account opening.  That doesn't seem to hard to do so, FREE $100. Earn a $25 Bonus after you add YOUR FIRST AUTHORIZED USER and make a purchase within this same 3-month period. This is another free $25 bucks if you have someone else on your card with you.  You also get 5% Cash Back on up to $1,500 in combined purchases before December 31, 2014 at Amazon.com, Zappos.com and select department stores.  This can be great for the Christmas purchases.  That's like an extra 5% coupon just for using your card.It seems as if they change the categories around every 3 months for what they give your the bonus cash back on.  That kind of stinks for me as I don't want to have to keep track of my rewards that closely.  I just want them to show up on my statement without me thinking about them.  It says, \"You'll enjoy new 5% categories every 3 months like gas stations, restaurants and Amazon.com. It's free and easy to activate your bonus each quarter!\"  Sounds like there is work involved with getting my rewards and I don't like that idea one bit. Then there is the unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases.  Now, that I understand.  I spend money, they give me 1% on all purchases. Sounds like no work involved, my kind of bonus.There is no over the limit fee, which is good.  I have gotten caught with that charge before and it stinks. There is a late fee of $35 dollars which seems pretty standard now days and you get a 21 day grace period. What would really eat my lunch on this credit card is the cash advance fee.

I was in need of a bank account for direct deposit of my paychecks from work and this offer seemed to good to pass up. Also the the amount of branch office locations and ATM's in my area was a deciding factor. The $12.00 monthly fee seemed reasonable also. I opened the account at a local branch office, deposited the $100 and after 10 days as promised they deposited $100 into my account. Everything was good, started getting my direct deposits, and an ATM card within a week. After a month of having the account I took a trip to LA. During my trip I went to make a purchase at a department store and my card was declined. So I got on the phone with the bank.After about a half hour I was able to get an actual customer service rep on the line. I was told my account had been put on hold and all funds were on hold. I was asked many questions that I could not answer at the time like exact. Questions like, what were the exact amount of the last 3 deposits made into the account. I was on vacation and had no documents to answer all the questions being asked of me. I was eventually Told there was nothing she could do and that I would have to come into an office and bring a long list of documents to prove my identity,residence, and other things. I could not do this while out of town. So I was forced to cut my trip short due to the fact I could not access MY money. Upon returning home I went to the office with documents I was asked to bring.  The bank guy never did give me a reason as to why my account was put on hold to begin with. He told me after showing all requested documents that the hold would be lifted within a week. 17 days later the hold was lifted.That same day I went and withdrew all of my money and opened an account with Wells Fargo, which I am still with today.

With this card, you can go over your limit without a monetary penalty.Because I have gotten so discerning in my card selections, I dislike the apr on this one.

So far I have had the card for about four months and have been able to pay down a lot more of my debt than before (when I was paying an arm and a leg in interest fees alone).

I think it's a great card for those who  fit into this credit range, as the interest rate for purchases is 0% for 15 months, and the regular rate afterwards can be as low as 12.99%. Some cards can start at 18%. There is no annual fee, and the grace period is a fair 21 days. However, there are no rewards.Because this card is for those who fall into a lower credit score, the fact there are no rewards is a good thing, because there will be no enticement to make purchases simply to get accumulate rewards. Ultimately, the benefit of the card is that it is standard and allows you flexibility without any unnecessary extras for new card holders.The card also offers 0% interest on Balance transfers, which is a optimal for paying off any other credit card on other higher interest cards. This is also the only nationally advertised deal with no transfer fee. The max late fee is $35, which is very fair, and just enough to cause new card holders to want to avoid the charge again without too much a punishment. Some cards can charge as high as $50 in late fees. The card has good customer service, and online transfers are easy to do as well. Payments can be made using the Chase app also. There are text messages and email alerts which remind you to make a payment. An interesting point to note is the vertical card design, as opposed to the standard horizontal one. I think the look of the card affects how people perceive and use the card, and because it's not as typical-looking, and perhaps not as aesthetically interesting otherwise, it may deter people from using it as much, which may be a helpful thing if you're trying not to spend but still need a card. It's a psychological connection, but worth noting.The Chase Slate also has \"Blueprint,\" a budgeting tool which helps you save money on interest and stick to your goals of paying down balances quicker. Just by having the card, this is completely free. Chase claims that customers who set up their plan and and stick to their \u201cSplit It\u201d or \u201cFinish It\u201d Blueprint plan usually pay their balance two times faster compared to their other cardholders. This obviously saves a lot of money over time, and is a unique tool.The Chase Slate card is good for those who are looking to build up their credit, or simply don't need a card with any extra bonuses. It is helpful to have in case of emergencies, and with the 0% introductory rate, you're not paying interest for the first year, which means you don't have to pay off the bill right away, a nice perk for those who do pay in full and on time. Even though there are no rewards, the simplicity of the card and how it encourages you to work to get better credit is the real reward of the card."},{"date":"2014-10-14","name":"Daniel Conti","user_id":"dmconti1","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"Don't fall for the credit card scam.

The rewards of the card are fairly competitive, with a $100 bonus after spending $500 in your first three months, a very easily-obtained bonus and a major selling point. Not only do you get that, but once you add an authorized user to the card and make a purchase during that same three month period, you get another $25 bonus. A total of $125 for simply signing up and using the card! With 5% cash back on different categories every three months, such as gas, restaurants, and Amazon.com, and 1% cash back on all other purchases, there's really no reason not to choose the card. While the standard 1% is competitive among cash-back cards, other cards do offer above 1% on all purchases; however, those cards don't have the 5% categories like the Chase Freedom card does. There is a limit to the spending that qualifies for 5% back, but it's high (up to $1,500 in category spending per quarter when you sign up). This means you can earn 5% on up to $6,000 of spending every year.In 2014, the Chase Freedom 5 percent cash back categories were Q1 (January 1-March 31, 2014): Gas stations, Starbucks, stores, and movie theaters, Q2 (April 1-June 30, 2014): Restaurants and Lowe's home improvement stores, Q3 (July 1-September 30, 2014): Gas stations and Kohl's, and Q4 (October 1-December 31, 2014): Amazon.com, Zappos.com and select department stores. As you can see, gas appeared for half of the year which is a great reward for a common purchase.Some cards come with high redemption thresholds (you have to redeem a certain amount of rewards to get the cash), and as a result, the cash back you've earned will not be usable until you've reached the threshold. To redeem cash back you have earned with Chase Freedom card, you need a minimum of $20, which is not too high, and shouldn't take too long to earn considering the nature of the rewards of the card. The money can be used for statement credits or direct deposits. Additionally, you always get a full 1-cent-per-point value, which means your rewards do not lessened when you redeem for cash back. The cash back can be used for travel, merchandise, concerts, games, gift cards, and paying off your balance.As someone with excellent credit, I think highly of this card because it rewards me for being timely with my payments. The maximum late fee is $35, which is not bad, especially if you pay your bill in full and on time. There is a grace period of 21 days, which is also helpful, and a nice cushion to have. There is no annual fee, and you can let your rewards add up without worrying if they will expire. There are also no inactivity fees. They also have excellent customer service, and if you have a Chase checking account, payments are even easier to make.

I like that a user can get additional miles just for using the card on other (non-BA) purchases; for instance, if you spend $800 a month in such purchases, that translates into 1000 miles a month, which in my opinion is really good. Another great feature especially for people who spend a considerable amount of time abroad is the feature of no foreign transaction fees.

Because I have a College Checking Account, I should be exempt from monthly maintenance fees.  However, at three different points in time, I've been hit with fees for no apparent reason.  Each time, I've had to go to a Chase Bank location and talk to the teller.  Three of the four tellers I've talked to have been nothing but helpful and were able not only to ensure the issue didn't occur again, but also to refund the maintenance fees charged.  At one location (a Chase bank attached to a ShopRite), the teller informed me that his hands were tied and nicely told me he was sorry he couldn't do more.  I suspect however that he simply didn't know how to resolve the problem.  I say this because when I later visited the location by my house, the lady there was able to refund my fees very easily.All in all, I've had great experience with the customer service in the Chase banks, which is the only reason I've kept my account there.  The ubiquity of Chase ATM's have made it a great convenience.  The online checking is very easy to use, and recently, they've upgraded a lot of their locations with electronic tellers.  These machines are just like ATM's, but have more capabilities, such as accepting checks and cash deposits.

They give you until the close of day to get out of the negative, so you are not slammed with fees, amazing! Also, I had a fraud issue and they were quick to resolve the issue and the local branch manager followed up to make sure everything was okay.

There's not a lot of \"You get THIS, but only if you spend X amount.\" Those kinds of gimmicks are never as awesome as they seem, so I'm grateful that this is straightforward. Modest bonus, but not one you have to fight for. 1% rewards. It seems pretty clear-cut. The rate is actually pretty low compared to other cards I've been looking at.Also, it's Visa. I've used a few different brands, and Visa really is accepted more places.  Even if a merchant says they accept Visa & say MasterCard, the Visa is less likely to malfunction or deny your card because you're in a different state.  (I really think MasterCard looks for excuses to not pay for stuff) Anyway, Visa is probably the most universally accepted.Last pro -DISNEY! That means you can use points on a vacation, which is pretty typical, but even if you're a more modest spender and don't rack up enough to buy airfare, you can still use rewards for Christmas presents and such. It's a pretty versatile brand for this card to be paired with.But there are some downsides.  That $50 bonus isn't going to go far in a Disney store, and definitely not in a park. So keep that in mind. Also, that 10% is only on selected items, which means stuff you probably have to coaxed into wanting.  The DVD's, toys, and games that you want probably won't be discounted.The last thing to consider is that credit card companies really are into loyalty.  Their faithful good customers get expedited treatment and unexpected perks. Eventually your kids will grow up, and you'll want a card that give rewards for things like gas or textbooks as opposed to a deluxe copy of Snow White.  So the drawback is that while faithfully paying your bill on time will still build good credit, that goodwill with the company will be lost when you inevitably have to get a new card."},{"date":"2014-07-14","name":"Sonya Torres","user_id":"SonyaMarieTorres","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"Have had this card for a little over a year.

For me, the Discover It card is a better choice, with no annual fee, cash back rewards (5% in rotating categories, up to 1% on other purchases), a portal offering shopping at 5-20% cash back, free FICO scores on your bill and an introductory 0% interest on purchases and transfers for the first 14 months!

In the beginning we were told we would need to have a minimum $300 balance OR have $25 or more being directed into our savings account monthly to avoid the service fee. I thought this wouldn't be an issue and chose to have $10 added weekly so we met this requirement and had the teller set it up. the following 2 months I noticed the service fee being taken out and finally called to find out what was going on. I was told that the fee had to be taken out in a chunk ( a one time deposit of $25 a month) versus several small installations. That even though we deposited more then was required, it was not in one chunk and would not be accepted in order to waive the fee. This wasn't explained to us at the time and though we could do it, I am extremely upset that I basically was being told how to spend my money.

One time paying the late fee of $35 will eat up the points you accumulate on $10,000 of purchases (and, paying interest on a carried balance will do the same). We use it for all grocery, gasoline, restaurant, utility bills and online purchases. Do NOT redeem your rewards for an online amazon.com purchase.

It is an above average credit card. I didn't give it a full five stars because they do not offer a Rewards program. I like the Introductory offer of 0% APR for the first fifteen months. They also offer 0% interest on Balance transfers, which is a great way to pay off any other credit card debt you might have on other higher interest cards. The interest rate seems to be in the standard range for credit cards these days. It's not great, being above 12.99%. However, it is about par for the course when compared with other credit cards. There is no annual fee, which is great. Overall, this is a good card if you take advantage of the Introductory offer and pay off your balance in full every month after the Intro period. I have a Discover It card and it's pretty similar - 0% APR Intro offer, no annual fee, etc. My card does have a Rewards program, though."},{"date":"2014-04-07","name":"Vera Thornton","user_id":"vera.gill","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I love the chase sapphire preferred credit card.

I have already had to go to the bank to get the charge reversed once. But the very next month they charged me another 12.00 again. I\u2019m going to have to go back to the local branch and raise a ruckus\u2026 Stupid bank they can\u2019t even get their fees straight. They have tons of fees. It seems every little thing you want them to do, there is a fee\u2013there is even a 25.00 fee for closing each of your accounts if it has been open less than 90 days. That means if you hate their service like I do, you still have to wait 90 days until you can get your money out. Basically they hold your money hostage or extort you if you want to take your money out and put it into a better bank. I will be closing my accounts once that minimum number of days is up and never doing business with them ever again! Steer clear of this bank!

I would much rather take into account the amount of interest and fees I'll be paying, because if I'm paying a very high interest rate on a credit card, it would be cheaper to just pay for a night in a hotel.The regular rate of 15.24% is average or even less than other reward cards.  The Venture Capital Rewards card can be a little less at around 14% all the way up to 20%, which is a huge interest rate to pay just to get some airline miles.  So, the Hyatt Credit Card has a fair interest rate for what you are getting.  They also have no annual fee for the first year, but it jumps up to $75 each additional year.  Depending on how much you travel and spend, will the higher interest rate and annual fee for a rewards card really benefit you when it comes to having nice accommodations when you travel?

My  old, grand-fathered account was excellent. Now that CEO Dimon, ELITE Dimon is in there, he is a leech, and if you do not have steady income, at a steady amount, steady pace each month, he will suck money out of us. He will charge you to have an account at his bank, of $ 10.00-12.00\/month. Did it ever occur to this rich elite that we do not have this steady stream of deposits because we are in an economic crisis that was caused by him and his kind? Rothschilds, for example? Bet they love to have dinner together.Anyways, I am sickened by these greedy, power-hungry people who rule over the poor, and take from them, little by greater. It is a plot, and they tell us that we should be happy that we allow them to take our money in their stinking banks. Whatever. I am totally not satisfied with the new banking policy that charges people if they have no job. It is disgusting, and it is the NEW banking. Just average, Dimon. You are a follower of rip-offs.That is what I think of my new Chase checking account. All of the banks are doing it--getting richer by nickling and diming the poor.

Not only that, but the card offers cash back for other purchases, too. For me, I'd probably still prefer my Chase-Amazon card because I don't travel a lot and make frequent purchases online. However, if you do travel a lot, then this card is potentially more appealing because of the large amount of money you can save on hotel stays. I should also mention that, like my rewards card, the fees and APR are quite high, so having this card takes a fair amount of financial responsibility. You have to time signing up at the right point, so you can take advantage of the 30,000 points, and you have to make sure you pay off your balance every month if you want to avoid that massive APR.

On the plus side, in-bank notary services are free.

You can earn 1% cash back and up to 2% on certain items. When it comes to cashing in your rewards points, there are many different options offered. You can receive cash back and use it towards your monthly statement, you can use it to earn \/ buy travel points, and they offer special discounts on many other things to use your rewards points against. I would say the only set back is the annual fee which is about $90.00. Depending on how much you spend and get back this might not be that big of a deal for you, but it is rather steep for some people.  Overall I think the card is worth it for the rewards given.

Both of these things are great and, when paid in full every month, it made perfect sense. It's got the added bonus of no annual fee, so that's spectacular as well.The only problem I really have with the card is the interest rate.

It's kind of a bummer that it doesn't offer you any 0% or lowered introductory rate, but since not everyone has balances to transfer, it's probably nicer for most people that the intro bonuses seem to make up for this. The cash advance rate and fee are steep, but that's pretty standard across all cards these days.

First person, they give you the same old speech. I asked to talk to someone who could get these charges reversed, I was transferred to a woman to said that the charges were valid and that there was \"no way\" they could be reversed. I told her that was ridiculous, and I told her that there is a Chase bank down the street and if I had to go into that branch and curse out every senior person there, I would do it. I told her to give me to someone above her and then I informed her that her customer service was really \"shady\". The third person I got was really nice and understanding and listened to me when I said all I needed was for one of those previous two flunkies to explain to me how can I avoid this in the future and send me a copy of the disclosure. She was EXCELLENT and not only helped me, didn't scold or look down on me. When I asked if one charge could be reversed (because I understood getting slapped on the wrist once) she said she would reverse both charges.

The most convenient thing about Chase is that they have so many locations and its difficult to find yourself in any non-rural area without a Chase nearby. Also, they are consistent and you can rest assured that there won't be any funny business with your accounts. With that being said, I have been spoiled by my credit union and have been thinking about canceling my Chase account on and off for awhile now, I just haven't yet because of direct deposit and auto bill-pay. The fees with the major banks (especially Chase and BofA are just getting out of hand. I mean, $34 for an overdraft???? Why? It's such a slap in the face to get charged these fees when something happens which is out of your control. Of course they may or may not reverse the fee ONCE, but you had better not do it again or there's no chance. The ATM fees are such a nuisance, many credit unions and smaller banks will never charge you any ATM fees and will even reimburse fees charged by other banks (how cool is that?)

It is a joint savings account and I am pretty happy with them overall. In all honesty, for me, the best thing about Chase is that they are literally all over NY, which is where I work. I work at different job locations, so if I ever need to get to a bank, I never panic because it seems like there is a Chase branch in every neighborhood, not to mention the ATM access at Duane Reade drug stores, which also comes in handy for me.In terms of the actual account, my interest rate isn't great, but I don't think any bank has great interest offers right now anyway. In terms of customer service, I think Chase is great. I only had one problem and Chase fixed it immediately. I am so satisfied with Chase that I am in the process of moving my accounts from other banks, and even a credit union into Chase because I feel that the other banks are taking advantage of their customers with ridiculous fees and rules. Chase doesn't do that, which is why I trust them with my money.I would recommend Chase bank to anyone that wants their money in a secure and customer friendly establishment."},{"date":"2013-11-29","name":"Angela Garcia","user_id":"soaringspirit","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I use my chase amazon rewards card more than any of my other credit cards.

The 50,000 bonus that you get with this card is also better than other competitors cards bonuses when you sign up.  That alone is worth the $95 annual fee that you need to pay for the card.

If you have need of the perks and bonuses which all seem to be travel related this might be the card for you since the first year has no annual fee, but many cards offer an even longer number of months without an annual fee and Chase has other cards with no annual fee ever. A $39 late fee every month can add $468 to your bill over the 12 month no annual fee time frame. This is an important consideration if you are cash strapped or in a business that can take 60 to 90 days for your payments to be received, If you do not need travel perks, $625 is worthless to you.

If you spend $1000 within the first 3 months of having your Hyatt Visa you will be rewarded with 2 free nights of a hotel stay.  This is really great for me because my husband and I do A LOT of traveling with our kids so to rack up points just for checking into our room and using this specific card is a win win situation for our family.

I've had VISA cards in the past with no problems, but if you are a Disney fan, this one has a few kickbacks that make it extra special.  First of all, any purchases you make at Disney World or a Disney Store will be discounted.  Getting 10 percent off at Disney World is a BIG deal considering how expensive it is just to go.  As an extra perk, being a card holder entitles you to a free private photo session with some \"secret\" characters at certain parts of the theme park.  When we went to Disney World last time, we didn't know this at first, so I'm telling you now.  Even though they wouldn't tell us who the characters were, when we went in the secret area, it was Micky and Minnie!  So again, how much you like this card really depends on how you use it.  If you live near a Disney World theme park or are a regular visitor, you will obviously get more benefit out of it than someone who is not.

Gosh and it is so easy to make $500 in purchases in the first 3 month just on groceries, so why not get this card? Without a doubt, this offer is a steal compared to other card offers that are on the market right now. For instance, I applied for a Bank of America Student Visa last year and it only came with a $25 bonus, which was bogus but besides the point. Still, I think the thing I love most about Chase Freedom credit card is its 0% APR introductory offer.

Although my credit isn't as high as I would like, they gave me a fair rate in the upper teens. The fact that they give you a $30 gift card as part of being approved is a great bonus and something I missed out on unfortunately. The reward point system is something that I don't put much value on being that it takes 100 points to get $1 off a purchase. For every $1 you spend at amazon you get 3 points. Considering this, you would have to spend about $34 to get $1 off a purchase. That isn't much of a saving, but better than nothing.

Chase has always responded to e-mails within four hours with quality information and politely. Their customer service representatives over the phone have always been top-notch as well. They are so helpful and polite, but they don't seem fake with lots of scripts like some other banks. I\u2019ve never been hit with an overdraft fee because they let me do ATM cash deposits and they always provide me with the correct information to ensure I never will be hit with a fee.

It really cuts down on trips to the ATM (but I do have an ATM and a branch location near my home, so I've never had to use another bank's ATM).

If often using American Airlines, Cathay Pacific or British Airways, this British Airways Credit Card is a good deal. If using this card to rake up miles, you can earn miles fast, with 2.5 and 1.25 miles per dollar spent. The annual fee is $95 which is a lot if not using this card often, but if you do use this card often, you will get more than $95 worth of mileage to be used towards purchase of air flights. The interest rate is at a modest 16%, which is a lot lower than many other cards. If you do travel a lot, there is no foreign transaction fee, which comes in handy when other cards charge a 3% fee.

If you frequently stay at Hyatt properties it will be easy to rack up points for free nights. This card is similar in rewards to the American Express Gold card which gives $500 back after spending $1000 in the first three months, or the Citi Thank you card which gives bonus Thank You points each year on your card member anniversary. I like that with the card you don't have to pay a resort fee when redeeming. Another perk is no limits to the points you can earn. The Discover card has limits as to how much spending goes towards the extra 5% bonus each quarter in rotating categories. I like the ability to earn unlimited points. At 3 points per dollar through Hyatt and unlimited points, it will be easy to rack up quite a few free hotel nights. Overall I think this card is definitely worth the annual fee.

I'm saving up so that I can splurge on a major purchase with no money coming out of pocket. About a year ago, my card was stolen, and the company was very efficient about dealing with the problem.

And when using this card either at a Marriott or for regular purchases, you can earn 3 or 1 point extra per dollar spent. And who can go wrong with a free 2 night stay at a hotel when activating this card. Now, the reason I cannot rate this card a 5 is for the following reasons. First, there is a $45 annual fee, where as other cards like Hilton do not. Also, if using a Hilton rewards card, you can earn 6 points per dollar at Hilton hotels, 3 points per dollar at gas stations and grocery stores, and 1 point per dollar everywhere else. When you do the math, the Hilton is a much better card, plus the intro reward is 40,000 points.

The last incentive of course is the $0 foreign transaction fee, which is extremely useful when conducting business overseas. The only thing about this card is you have to have an excellent credit score to be approved. Some people might complain about the $95 annual fee, but remember, this is a business card, not a personal credit card.

I personally would continue to use the Bank of America Signature Visa Card due to the lack of annual fees plus the cash back they offer is more useful."},{"date":"2013-10-22","name":"Darlynn Hall","user_id":"darlynn.hall","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":2,"review":"The fees that are charged and the interest make this card less than stellar.

If you are a business man or woman or someone who travels a lot this card is a really good idea. All of the reward that you can receive have to do with a nice stay in a hyatt hotel.

Since the balance has to be paid in full at the end of the month, you do not accrue interest which is nice but some businesses need to have an actual credit card because you may not have a 30 day turnaround time for your profits to pay it back. Other than that, the reward points are fantastic and the highest I have seen recently for a card. It would be worth it if you were putting all of your expenses that you had to pay anyway onto the card as long as you had the ability to pay the balance off within one billing cycle.

Initially you might be enticed by the chance for flight rewards and no initial annual fee, but this card is catered to the wealthy. After your first year with this card you will be forced to pay 95$ a year just to keep your service with them. During your use of this card you will want to fly as this is the main benefit of this, but to get some decent rewards you must spend thousands to get anywhere. Anyone may obtain a Travel together ticket every year, but to do so you must spend 30,000+ each year, and in my opinion that is outrageous. If you fly very very frequently for business and get compensated back, or if you just have lots of expendable money You should look into this card more, otherwise I wouldn't suggest it.

I am a person who likes to stay in one location and not travel to often so this is not the card for me, but if you like getting out and about, renting hotels this could be helpful. Pros are you get an initial bonus of 2 free nights which is really nice, and there is no initial annual fee, which leads me to the cons. Things I dislike about this is the annual fee of 75$ after year 1, and that to even be qualified to use this card you need Excellent credit.

My favorite is 5% on the gas station since gas is super expensive.  I closed this card once the free period was over. I end up with a higher APR and I never paid late but I didn't want to risk it.

I also really like the rewards given with this card. Since the Hyatt is virtually everywhere, and is a luxury hotel, this was a no brainer for us as a family. We love the Hyatt, and the Hyatt bonuses are great and easy to rack up. We recently went to Europe, and had enough points to get a free time in a very high class Hyatt in Paris, France for a few days.

The Ink Bold card has some good rewards like 5 times the points per dollar for the first 50,000$ you spend on select items, (this will take most a while) so you have a great deal of time to rack up points. The points are 1-1 on travel programs you might be interested which is nice for the adventurous types. On the other hand the Ink Bold has a 95$ annual fee after the first year and your balance MUST be paid in full each month. In the case of this Chase card I would suggest it almost as much as the two credit cards I love; The Amazon and PayPal cards.

They asked me a lot of strange verification information like where did I lived in 1998 and what was my first car. This whole process took at least 30 minutes and it was 9PM.

While you get a small bonus of 2.5% back on British Airway plane tickets, you have to buy A LOT of plane tickets in order to break even with the annual fee.

It was a great card to build credit with, as they automatically raised my credit over the years without any badgering. The rewards are great if you use Amazon a lot. You can use your rewards points at Amazon at any time, which is nice because a lot of similar cards require a minimum amount to withdraw your rewards. The interest rates are not too bad, especially considering I got the card when I had very little credit history. Chase's online payment system and customer service are also both top notch- when I lost my card I had no problem talking to them and getting a new one sent out for no cost."},{"date":"2013-09-09","name":"Tiffany McLean","user_id":"tiffmclean","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"The Ink Bold Business card has a really decent initial bonus for first signing up. You get 50,000 points if you spend $5,000 in the first three months. If you are planning to purchase quite a few things for your business that's a pretty good deal compared to other cards like the Capital One Spark Select Business Credit Card that doesn't offer any bonus points up front. It is a bit of a hassle that there is an annual fee after the first year, and it's pretty high, but if you factor in the bonuses it would probably make it worth it. It's also great that you can earn 5X rewards points on things like cell phones, office supply purchases and more.

The bonus is five times the normal 1% cash back, and Chase partners with some very popular vendors so that they can offer you the best cash back at the best stores.

The intro 0% APR lasts a few months longer than the typical twelve months like on other cards. This is great since there's no balance transfer fee, meaning if you get approved for this card, you can get an extra 0% APR on your balances for over a year! There's also no annual fee, which is great for these kinds of cards that are usually just used for taking the balance from another card. I think it's a lot better than the Capital One Classic Platinum Credit Card which only has 0% APR for less than a year. The only drawback is that you need excellent credit for this card, which may be a pain for many.

It's a lot better than American Express which is sometimes not taken by smaller mom and pop shops. This card is great for teenagers who want to buy stuff online on their own without going through mom or dad first. The fact that you can only spend as much as you have makes it even better to teach younger kids money management. The customer service is also great with Chase!

They offer simply the BEST rewards for their customers. Chase Sapphire Preferred Card offers a huge incentive bonus to join- the equivalent of 500 dollars in travel is just wonderful and no foreign transaction fees? Simply divine. The only thing that I raise my eyebrows to is the 95 dollar annual fee. That hurts. I suppose it might be worth it, but that really cuts into your savings when you have to spend 95 dollars to continue using it. This card reminds me of the Capital One credit card during their Double Miles Challenge. They doubled all the points from the previous year, and that would probably equal out to what the Sapphire card gives you in just a few months. Anyway, I think this card is great and I see what Gary Shaffer says about the negative aspects of the card, but if you have excellent credit then I don't think that you'll be using the features that have additional fees like the cash advance or balance transfers.

The rates are good and are pretty close to the Chase Freedom and the Capital One cards that I have.  I like the competitive fees too, especially the balance transfer fees and that you get three to six months of 0% interest on balances.  I don't think the rewards program is very competitive though.  There is nothing to entice you to start using it, like a new member bonus.  The actual bonus program is normal too, there is nothing really that sets this apart from another program.

I don't think many people can spend $100,000 a year on belongings to redeem the 25,000 points. One unique feature of this card is the ability to transfer your points to any airline at a 1 to 1 rate.

Since there are other miles cards available with lower (or no) annual fees, I wouldn't rank this at the top of my list of choices.It's nice that they give you 30,000 miles right off the bat; this does help offset the sting of the fee a little, but given that the miles are a one-time deal, and the annual fee is recurring...well, you'll just have to weigh those two factors for yourself. If you use this card A LOT, then I could still see it being worthwhile. But if you're a more average user like me, who just charges a grand or two a month and pays it right off, I can't see it being worth your while.The 3 miles per $1 spent on United airfares is good, but still about normal for single-airline travel rewards cards. The consistent 2 miles per $1 spent on gas, home improvement purchases, groceries and dining is what I see as being this card's greatest advantage over others. Other rewards cards sometimes bonus these, sometimes don't (or if you're talking about a weird one like Discover, they'll bonus them one month, and not another...sheesh), so getting them consistently over the life of the card is great.It's nice in that it doesn't charge you a premium rate for balance transfers, but they still nail you for cash advances (which, admittedly, is standard practice). That said, I've seen lots of cards with worse rates than this one.Bottom line is, if you're a dedicated United flyer who flies a lot for business, this will probably be a reasonably rewarding card for you."},{"date":"2013-08-01","name":"William Reyes","user_id":"williamreyesn","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I am actually very interested in the Continental Airlines OnePass Plus Credit Card since I fly with Continental often.

I could not believe how much less I was being charged in interest fees each month.  It was over a $45 difference.  I actually kept paying the same amount until the balance was paid off.  It was just that now this $45 was going towards principle instead of the interest fee.  Another nice thing about the card is their cash back feature.

The only gripe I have with this card is that there are no rewards for purchases. I have yet to take advantage of the Blueprint feature. I've read up on it and think it's a pretty neat feature.

The fact that it is free checking is awesome, there are really no fees, hidden or obvious. The fees are passed on to the institution who allows the card to be used, which is like 10 cents per swipe or something miniscule. I have had no problems with my account. ATM's are super fast, especially to some other companies where it takes 5 minutes to make a withdrawal or deposit and I can do it in 30 seconds. Good customer service, always friendly, always helpful. They even have online customer support which is handy.

I got a 40,000 point bonus, which translated to a $400 credit, how awesome is that? This is the absolute best travel card, especially for those who travel frequently and spend a lot.  Every time you use points to book travel through Chase, 20% of those points are automatically refunded. For example, 50,000 pints becomes 65,000, and $500 becomes $625. Again, awesome.  You earn 2 points per dollar spent on travel and dining and one point per dollar elsewhere. Once a year every year, Chase pays out a 7% rewards dividend. The annual fee is $95 but was waived the first year. Having the card for about a year, I\u2019ve had to deal with customer service of course, and my experience was about average.

I tried once to buy a computer online with it and they denied the purchase, at first. They wanted to make certain it was me, because I've never bought anything that expensive with this card before.

I've had this card for well over five years and am still using to this day, along with my other Chase credit cards. The benefit of the 5% cash back offer on my daily basic purchases helps me feel better about my expenses. When I was approved for this credit card, they gave me a pretty decent credit limit.

Now the transition had its hiccups, I could not sign up for bill pay through my checking account for some odd reason however after talking with customer service they were able to resolve this problem and the next day I was able to sign up. Ever since then things have been super easy. My notifications come on time. I can see everything through the website. There are no annoying separate windows that pop up when I need to pay a bill. The worst thing I hated about the met life system was the fact that sometimes it would forget my information and I would have to type in my routing and checking account number again.

Since we were already planning a trip down there with this card, it meant we got a lot of great perks when we got to the park. Such as the meet and greet with Disney Characters, the kids loved it. They got to have a photo with Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. They have that picture framed on their wall now and will probably never forget it!

Highly recommended, no annual fee and have never had an issue.

I was initially attracted to the lack of yearly fees and start up fees. After all, no one wants to pay just to have a credit card. I have to say I have never been hit with hidden fees or anything sneaky. Chase seems to be a good, upstanding company. I really like that you can make payments online. The website is very useful in that it keeps all your purchase and payment information well organized. My friend also has a Chase Slate card and about a year ago she had her wallet stolen and unauthorized purchases were put on the card by the thief. Chase did not hold her responsible for any of the charge and they didn't make her jump through hoops to get them taken off either. When I first got my card I  spoke with a representative on the phone for help getting started and she was very polite and helpful.

Getting everything set up was relatively painless. We got our debit and credit cards within just a few days of signing up. We also got starter checks to use immediately while we waited for our ordered ones. Our business banker is usually quick to answer questions and the manager helps when he's not available.

I generally use it for gas and grocery store runs.

It doesn't charge any annual or monthly fees so long as you pay the balance at the end of the month (I always do) and then you accumulate the standard points to earn a percentage of your spending back. They try to make you use them on amazon but you can actually just get a credit toward your statement where each point equals one cent.

In January on 2011, they transferred out all the money from my checking account. I spoke to Chase and was told it was to payback the credit card debt I owed them. I informed them it was discharged in BK. After faxing a number of documents and being insulted by their employees. They finally put the money back in my account. The money was gone for 5 days. They made it appear it was gone for only 2 days. Then two weeks later, they did it again. This time to pay off the money I owed for the second credit card I had with them.

I have accumulated rewards in the several hundred dollar range by this point in time.  I cannot say  I have always been able to pay it off in time every single month as life happens, but during the times I couldn't I felt like in the previous months the rewards I had received helped offset it.  At one point I had my credit card information stolen, or skimmed from a retailers computer that a thief had hacked.

On my card, you cannot redeem cash rewards until you have enough points for $20.00. On other chase cards, you can redeem cash rewards whenever you have any amount of points.

Although our original goal was to accumulate enough cash\/points for kayaks, we ended up purchasing a riding lawnmower with our Chase Freedom cash back rewards.

It has been a few months after that now however, and the bliss of 5% cash back on select purchases and 1% cash back on other purchases has been replaced with annoying fees for no apparent reason and annoying emails back and forth to the company.  I really liked this card and the plethora of rewards that were available.  I pay my full balance EVERY month and have never EVER been late on a payment with them, however Chase thinks they can throw penalties on your account saying you didn't pay in full the month before and call it \"interest\"! What a crock.  They resolve the crappy fees after I contact them, but it really is a royal pain to go through month after month.  Each month it is some new fee to pay.  It has gotten so annoying I am considering closing my card.  I also had a issue with security within my first year of being a customer.  When it boils down to it Chase really can't be trusted with your personal information and will try to pull a fast one on you and charge you left and right for petty things, even if you are a responsible cardmember.  They'll act like it is your fault when you contact them, and then remove the fees anyways.

I really enjoy using Chase\u2019s mobile alerts and appreciate how easy it is to check my balance. Once I had an issue where a website was charging my debit card and I was unable to cancel the charges. I went to Chase and worked with a banker who was very helpful and gave me the customer service number for the website. After I was unable to contact customer service, the banker went ahead and cleared the charges. He also cleared the overdraft fee that was charged to my account, due to the website. My only complaint with Chase is that it seems costly to open a regular account with them once my college checking account will have expired.

First, Chase Bank has very convenient locations in the New York\/Long Island area. E.g. If I am hanging out far away from home, I don't have to worry about searching far for a Chase Bank to take cash out if need be. The customer service is great as well at every bank. Last and most importantly, it was very easy to open up an account at Chase. My only problem with Chase is their phone customer service. They use out of the country people to help you over the phone and half of the time they don't know what they are talking about. I highly recommend going to the nearest bank if you have any inquiries.

It is just another example of banks being greedy. Second, their savings accounts give very little interest. You might as well invest your money into gold. That is how slow it is! I also find their customer service to be average while I have found banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America to be much friendlier.

A few times I had to call up customer service due to questions that I had about my account. Every representative I have talked to has been extremely helpful and has resolved any problems or questions I have had. I love the Chase Freedom rewards points because they allow me to get cash back after spending a certain amount on particular items, which is a great added bonus to having this credit card.

At the time I was younger and had not established as much credit, so the card I signed up for has a higher interest rate that, to this day cannot be changed. I knew this up front, but years later being unable to lower the interest rate is irritating.

I also save a little extra when I buy Walmart gift cards and use them for gasoline \u2013 you get rewards points for your purchase, then you get 3 cents off each gallon of gas purchased through Murphy USA, the fuel sold through Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club, when you use your Walmart gift card.

By way of background, I generally pay off the entire balance of my credit cards every month, so I am really only interested in rewards.  The Chase Freedom Card is adequate for these purposes since it offers a solid 1% back, which is well within the median of credit card rewards in the current economic environment.  The revolving categories can be great for earning as much as 5% back, but I have seldom found it to be too useful unless the bonus is given for  staples such as gasoline or groceries.My primary card is still a 2% back AMEX card, but since AMEX is not necessarily accepted everywhere, I keep this card as a backup.

Not just this, I also earn points for every dollar I spend at Marriott locations, on dining, car rental and airline tickets purchased directly with the airline and on eligible purchases everywhere else.

This card started out for me with a really tiny credit limit, but before I'd even had it a year, it started going up and did so at a much faster rate than some of my other cards.I wouldn't rate the customer service from Chase as being quite as helpful as the people over at Discover, but they are probably better than the Capital One customer service agents. The experience you might have with a credit card is often based upon experiences with their customer service agents. And for Chase.... they're okay, but it's hard to negotiate with them on anything.They are quite punitive if you have any mishaps with payments - it is nearly impossible to negotiate down an interest rate if you are late on a single payment for any reason.

In addition to the regular 1% cashback, the rotating quarterly categories that give 5% are usually much better than the categories offered by competing 5% cards (Discover More, Citi Dividend).

It does make your Disney vacation very affordable and enjoyable. These discounts even extend to any Disney merchandise you buy at certain Disney locations. Signing up for this card and spending $500 in the first three months entitles you to a $100 Disney gift card. I also benefit a great deal with the 2% cash back that they offer on purchases made at restaurants, gas stations, grocery stores and most Disney locations, and 1% cash back on all other purchases. I found it pretty cool when they asked me to choose a credit card design for my card from 8 different options.

The Pros are that there are no foreign usage fees, you get points for pretty much anything travel-related you can imagine (including staying at the Marriot, obviously) and the intro points when you are accepted are very generous.

Online banking and bill pay is a breeze and you definitely get the feeling all activity is secure do their multi-factor authentication system. I also liked the design of their mobile application for Android. Checking for updated balances after a recent transaction is also very fast.

After all, I just kind of got a letter saying \u201chey, yeah, btw, we're taking over.\u201d Depending on what branch you go to, you can have a bunch of nice, helpful people, or alternately, some of the least professional, grumpiest people ever, who probably shouldn't work in a bank. Generally though, if you stick to one branch for a long time, the people start warming up to you. However, there is still no concept of a \u201cpersonal banker\u201d like there are in other banks, just a friendly person behind a desk. Overall, the actual Chase computer and banking system itself is pretty easy. I can check my balance on my phone or computer. The only thing that's bothersome is when I log in from the same computer or cell phone, but with a different browser. It acts like it's never seen me before. Over the years, after many different banking experiences, I've tended to stick with Chase, because I feel that my money is safest there.

They contact me whenever the slightest charge, even just $5 spent at a gas station in the middle of nowhere during a road trip, doesn't make sense to them and I really like that. To some people it might be annoying but I really like how closely they are monitoring my debit card in case of theft. When I was only 19 I studied abroad in Europe and completely forgot to call Chase to let them know that I was leaving. They cancelled my card right away after my first expenditure but one quick 30 minute phone call later, I was okay to use my card again. I also like how there are Chase ATMs everywhere. I am originally from the Chicago area, where there are Chase banks every two blocks it seems, so I was worried when I moved away to grad school in another state whether or not they would have much of a presence there or even a decent office.

To my surprise, once they had me as a customer it was an uphill battle to make a simple car payment with them. I was repeatedly told to pay my car payment over the internet or phone by 2 of the tellers. I felt like a child being scorned by my mother. I did not have internet at that time. Then every month I went in there for 3 years I would be sent to one of the assistants so they could help me with \"MY PROBLEM\", for a simple car payment. The two older teller ladies just don't have the time to deal with anyone's questions. In the process of being \"helped\" I somehow signed up for paperless statements and billing that no one could fix. It almost made me late with some payments. Again \"my problem\". When I first opened my account I was told I qualified for a credit card with a 500$ limit. She had looked at my credit information and my car loan information, (21.5% interest rate for a 09' Ford Focus) and said I already qualified. I received my denial paper pretty quickly though. When I went down there to close my account because I was lied to, all I got was line after line of all the things I would have to go through to close my account and fees (don't forget the fees), which would tie up my money for the next two weeks, or so I was told. No help from no one not even over the phone, just the runaround. I tried to get a credit card each year, but NO, NO, NO. Told me my credit was too bad. I refinanced my car for 6.99% at another bank and got approved for a credit card just days after I went to Chase and they denied me for a refinance and credit card again due to \"poor credit\".

I use my credit card for virtually every purchase, and I view the 1% as free money essentially. The rotating 5% cash back categories is a huge bonus as well. My discover card does something similar to this (although their categories are less practical for me) so having a card like this one comes in handy. I've been able to buy several presents with what I've earned with cash back. Finally, the ability to use the card to get more discounts online has been a great perk. All in all,  I can't recommend this card highly enough both due to the customer service and the fantastic cash back options."},{"date":"2013-01-25","name":"Christine Harris","user_id":"charris84","verified":false,"product":"Chase Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"I had a checking account with Chase for a little over a year. While banking with them, I had several issues with cash deposits not being credited on the same day, which ended up causing overdrafts. When I pointed out the issue and even backed myself up with receipts showing the deposit and that it was a cash deposit (which by their policy should have credited the very same day), they still wouldn't do anything about it, for the overdraft fees that THEIR error caused. Banking with Chase is what ultimately turned me off of big corporate banks and made me return to small town credit unions instead. It felt like no one at Chase really cared about me as a customer. To them, it just seems like you're just another number, another commission for their paycheck. I would never go back to Chase Bank, even if they were the last bank available in my town."},{"date":"2013-01-25","name":"Alicia Walker","user_id":"aliciarig1","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I've had my card for a little over 2 years, and it has not disappointed me yet.

I had my wallet stolen and some fraudulent purchases were made with my card before I had the chance to call in and report my missing card. The customer service agent was extremely helpful and fixed the issue immediately, and was able to issue a new card to me within just a few days. When it comes to their rates, I believe they are very fair and straightforward. There are no surprises as I have had with other card companies.

Thankfully, I don't have to worry about that anymore these days.Customer service has always been great. Whenever I'd had an issue with fraudulent charges on my account, it was almost immediately resolved. Dealing with a bad flower vendor that tried to replace the premium bouquet I ordered with a cheap balloon and a small pot was also resolved. They've also been great at helping me freezing all of my credit cards related to Chase when my wallet was stolen.Customer representatives have also been helpful. Even though I was trying to close an account because it no longer made sense to keep it open due to minimum balance requirements, they found a loophole that allowed me to keep it without the minimum balance requirement.Also, the Chase app has made banking convenient as hell when I have to transfer funds or deposit a paycheck via mobile phone.

I did not become a Chase customer on purpose, but rather by default when Washington Mutual went under and Chase acquired their customers. Nevertheless, I have found Chase to be perfectly adequate for my needs.The primary interest I have in a bank is the checking and savings accounts. I do not want to pay unnecessary fees for the checking account, and Chase has proven adequate in this regard. On the savings front, I really do not care all that much about interest rates, which is good, because I make much less at Chase than I could elsewhere. I mostly care that it exists, and that it is easy to transfer money between savings and checking. Chase is good in that regard.I like having an option for online bill pay. Chase accomplishes that, although frankly their bill pay system seems like it was built as an afterthought, and maybe 10 years ago. It is a clumsy interface. But it is nice not to have to pay for stamps for my bills.I also like that Chase is everywhere. It makes it easy for me to find an ATM when I need one.All in all, I would not say that Chase has wowed me, but I guess I do not really need a bank to wow me.

Their iPhone app makes it easy to deposit a check simply by taking a picture of it (although if the amount being deposited is a lot, you have to deposit it at a bank location in person). Another reason I like Chase is because they have great customer service. Probably one of my best experiences with Chase has been their managers' willingness to reverse debit overdraft fees. Because of some automatic bill payments, I ended up having a negative balance and Chase charged a $35 dollar fee for it.

I currently have two checking accounts, three credit cards, my mortgage, and a student loan through them. I'll be honest; I did work for them for two years, which is why I started banking with them in the first place, so I probably have a different insight than a lot of other people. That being said, I feel that a lot of times when someone is upset, say about an overdraft fee, it's the customer's fault not the bank's. You can't expect nothing to happen when you spend more money than you have, don't check your balance, and don't take the time to understand how online banking works. That's not to say of course that the bank doesn't make mistakes, because they definitely do. My most recent experience with them, however, and the reason I gave them five stars, is because of something they recently did for my husband and I that they most certainly did not have to do. My husband recently joined the armed services and decided to invoke our rights under the SCRA (Servicemembers Civil Relief Act) and request a reduction in our credit card interest rates. We have three cards with them but only requested the reduction on two of the cards because my husband is only an authorized user on the third card, not an actual owner. Because of this we didn't think that it qualified under the SCRA. Our mortgage would also technically be covered but we did not request that either because our interest rate was already less than the maximum rate allowed under the SCRA. As it turns out they reduced the interest on the third card as well, without us asking for it. A few days later we received a call from the mortgage department at Chase. They noticed that we had changed our checking accounts over to military accounts and asked if we had invoked our rights under SCRA. We told them about the credit cards and we were informed that they were in the process of reducing the rate on our mortgage as well. We told them that the rate was already under the maximum rate under SCRA and they told us that they were just going to reduce it even further and give us back the difference. Part of the SCRA provisions are that the request has to be initiated by the service member. We only initiated it for two credit cards but Chase went ahead and covered another credit card and our mortgage without us asking for it. If the accounts are included under SCRA Chase has to give us back the difference, so they basically gave us back money that they didn't have to because we didn't ask for it. I know people have their issues with banks but this just blew me away. In total we got back around $800 which I know is just a drop in the bucket for them, but it was big for my husband and me. The fact that they didn't have to and did anyway, I think says a lot."},{"date":"2013-01-08","name":"Julie Provost","user_id":"julieprovost1","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"We have had a Chase Freedom card for about 4 years now.

Instant gratification! I had somebody tell me once that it would make better sense to use my Amazon card to shop on Amazon, but accumulate cash rewards. This is because, in theory, you would be buying what you buy on Amazon.com anyway, plus get three points for every dollar you spend on Amazon.com with this credit card.

The initial perks are fantastic. If you spend more than $500 within the first three months of ownership, they give you $100 cash back. It's fairly easy to spend $500 if you just put all of your purchases that you normally buy in there. In addition to that, it's easy to rack up a lot of cash back just from the credit card use alone. You can get 1% cash back on all purchases or 5% on select categories that cycles every quarter. If you use a credit card for all of your purchases this can add up to a lot. I've already gotten about $300 cash back this year alone."},{"date":"2012-12-26","name":"Andrea Hollander","user_id":"Yafael1","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"The Chase card was my first credit card.  I received it when I was a senior in high school (under my father's watchful eye) to help me build credit.  I found they gave very clear statements and expectations however the information was very confusing for someone new to credit.  Later I had some problems paying the bills after college and ran into trouble trying to make payments.  They did try to assist me in that and were willing to accept a payoff after a charge off, so that made it much easier. I would recommend a chase card for someone who is not a beginning credit card holder however and education on credit is a must before getting any credit card."},{"date":"2012-12-26","name":"Mary Lopert","user_id":"jadedangel138","verified":false,"product":"Chase Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I have had my Chase checking account for close to four years now.

I rarely actually have to step inside a physical Chase location, but when I do, the staff has always been friendly and helpful. The big draw to the Freedom card though is Chase's point reward system. I use my credit card so often simply because of it. Normally, the rate of earning points is fairly low--something like 1 point earned per each $10 purchase (with 2000 earned points equaling $20). However, each quarter of the year, you can activate a special 5% back reward on various types of purchases (gas stations and movie theaters, for example), which Chase selects depending on the season. You can also use Chase's \"Ultimate Rewards Mall\" online to earn additional points while shopping online--so it's a great bank if you like to do most of your shopping from home. You can spend your earned points in various ways--you can pay yourself back (ie. Chase will literally deposit the amount earned back into your account), purchase gift cards from various stores, or use the points to make a donation to a worthwhile charity.Of course, there is so much more to say about Chase -- like it's great protection services (eg. customizable alerts about money being withdrawn from your account or spent at stores, overdraft options, etc.) -- but these digital features plus the amount of money that can be made back from the rewards really make this bank stand out for me.

Even though I was not fortunate enough to open a new account with the $125.00 offer, I would still say this is one of the best banks I have ever had an account with. You are able to go online and view your bank statements, the amount of money you have on your account, pay bills, and request customer support if needed. You are also alerted via text, call, and email if they detect fraud on your account, if money over the amount you would regularly spend was taken out. For example, let\u2019s say you set your spending limit on your alerts up to $100.00. If more than that was deducted from your account they would contact you to have you either confirm the transaction or deny it in order to resolve the issue. You can also set up high school and college checking accounts for kids or a sibling and teach them a bit about responsibility (you can go online, and see how much they have been spending, and limit it too).

Several years ago they were bought out by Chase. For approximately a year, there seemed to be no difference in the terms of service. Then I began receiving information in the mail about new fees, etc. My original checking accounts were no fee accounts with no minimum balance requirements. When I received notice that Chase would be charging a $10 fee for my accounts, I went into the local branch to close one of the accounts. I was told by the representative that I could be \u201cgrandfathered in\u201d and would never be required to pay the fee for accounts holding under the minimum balance, so I was convinced to retain all my accounts with Chase since they were agreeing to keep my terms as originally agreed. After a period of time (I don't recall whether it was 6 months or a year later) I began seeing service fees posted on my bank statement. When I contacted Chase, I was told it was an error and they removed the fees. Then a bit later, it occurred again. This time I was told that the fees would be applied and that they were revoking their original stance that I was \u201cgrandfathered in.\u201d I reluctantly accepted this, since it was explained that they are a very large bank and must adhere to their standard policies. I simply closed 1 account and have continued to swallow the $10 fee. However, I also noted that they were charging an overdraft fee if a deposit and a withdrawal were made on the same day. They began holding off posting the deposit until the day's end, after all debits had been posted. They have since ceased this practice after a class action lawsuit was brought against them.I still have accounts with Chase because I have been traveling a great deal. However, I am planning to change my accounts to another bank soon, not only because of the above issues, but also because I am finding that there are several large cities like Baltimore and Buffalo, where there are no banking branches, which creates a great inconvenience to me when I need to make a cash deposit. Overall, I would rate this bank as more of a big money bank and not equipped to serve the middle class.

Well I'm sure Bank of America has its perks, however, one thing I can say is that I had an account with them for a month or so and the ATM was very slow. The software is very slow and not responsive, thus the long lines at the ATM. You never see a long line at the Chase ATM because the software is quick, responsive, and you are getting your cash, depositing your checks, or whatever it is that you need to do, you are doing it more quickly than everyone else around you. I know people will say that Chase has a lot of fees, and that may be true there are fees for certain things, however, I just think that everything is so convenient with Chase that I am willing to pay a little more for things. They don't offer free checking unless you're a college student or maintain a minimum balance, which for me personally isn't a problem but for others it may be. Their online banking is superb, you can use Chase Quickpay to transfer money for free (the other person doesn't even have to be a Chase customer). Their software is fast, the customer service is friendly and helpful. Not to mention the Chase Freedom is one of the best credit cards out there. Honestly I can't say enough good things about Chase."},{"date":"2012-12-19","name":"Jason Kidd","user_id":"jason_kidd_14268769","verified":false,"product":"Chase Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I use Chase and its online Checking option.

I really like this and think that it\u2019s better than some banks that don't allow this option. Chase also makes sure to call me whenever they feel that someone put a false charge on my credit card.

It is by far the best credit card I have ever owned. I have redeemed points and earned points in almost every fashion that they offer without  having any issues or hiccups. I've redeemed points for items offered through Chase's website, received those items promptly and exactly as described. I have also redeemed points straight into my Chase checking account and that transaction went through by the next business day. You can also redeem points for gift cards. Sometimes these cards can be lower than 1 to 1 (ex. redeem 900 points for a 10 dollar gift card).   Everything you purchase through this card you will at least earn 1% cash back. They also offer 5% on a variety of things every quarter. These aren't garbage offers either. During the summer it was gas stations and travel. During 2013 they will gas stations twice (1st and 3rd quarter) and during the last quarter amazon.com. You can also earn extra points by shopping through their ultimate rewards website. I bought an iPad through the apple store, earned extra points. This website easy to navigate and I've never had any trouble.The only thing that might not work for some people is the interest rate, mine is 9.99%.

Then, Chase took over. Our favorite tellers were moved, which was sad but understandable, as merging companies sometimes requires people to be moved around. But, the new people were not as helpful. When we closed one of our accounts it took many days to close, and we encountered added fees. They then allowed a withdrawal from our only opened account that we had not authorized, which resulted in some overdraft fees. The withdrawal was eventually reversed, after several long and heated phone conversations, as the branch manager was of no help. However, they still expected us to pay the fees. Needless to say, we no longer bank with Chase."},{"date":"2012-12-19","name":"Debrah Gutt","user_id":"debrahg","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I can't really say enough good things about this credit card.  As long as you use it responsibly you can really add up the money you earn very quickly.  There are 5% cash back categories rotating every 3 months but half the time those categories are gas, which is great especially if you drive around a lot like I do.  Also the other half of the time you get great categories like Amazon.com or restaurants, so if you eat out a lot or shop online this is a great card as well!  The only limitation is that the 5% bonus only stacks up for the first $1500 spent per 3 month period.  However, don't forget you get 1% cash back everywhere else which is unlimited!  This is not like other points where the value of a point isn't equivalent to 1 cent.  You can straight cash out points for CASH!  100 points is 1 dollar.  No catches, no gimmicks, straight cash.  Also if you're a Chase checking customer you get a bonus 10 points for every purchase (big or small!)  So if you get a small coffee for 70 cents you just earned OVER %10 cashback (around %15 to be exact).  In fact on any purchase under 5 dollars you will always earn at least 3% cash back as a Chase checking customer.  Also as a signup bonus you can get anywhere from $100-200 dollars just look for good offers online.

To begin with, they offer you $125 (variable \u2013 sometimes more or less) to sign up with them for a checking account. While this was a nice perk, I switched banks because I was unhappy with my prior bank, as well as for ease of access in managing funds with my fiance, who had had Chase for several years and was quite happy with them. Our accounts had the option to be linked, which was fantastic. I can see his checking balance online, he can see mine, although we both have separate accounts and debit cards. This allows us to have our own funds, manage our own money, while still having the benefits of a shared checking \u2013 we can transfer funds easily between accounts when needed.When you have overdrafts or missed payments with Chase, they have a policy where they will refund a certain number of those fees every year; for me, at least, it's $100. That is so convenient whenever one of us writes a check and forgets to tell the other. Moreover, you have 24 hours to correct a negative account as well. Overall, it's a fantastic bank for someone who's poor, or careless, or in college. Customer service has been pretty great as well, although I'm much less concerned with that than with the bank's actual policies. Calling them has been helpful and quick, and the bank tellers near me made sure to learn our names, and greet us, remembering things about us e.g. \u201chow's the wedding planning...\u201d Very personalized."},{"date":"2012-12-19","name":"jason buonomo","user_id":"chicago17","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"This is easily one of the best, if not the best credit card I have ever owned.

I also like that with the Chase Freedom card you can redeem the points for cash at any time. I have another rewards card that can only be redeemed in increments of $50.

This ended when they started charging me fees for anything and everything they could think of. Needless to say the fees killed me and I had to close the account and move onto a better bank. Chase was a shining light at the end of the tunnel that offered me an answer of a better bank. At first, I loved Chase. Easy to get along with, nice people, convenient location, etc. When I used to go out of town sometimes I'd have trouble finding a BB&T ATM. This was a problem of the past with Chase. Everywhere I went I was sure to find a Chase ATM so that I could avoid any pesky surcharges. Alas, the good times could not last. I recently graduated school with my Master's degree in Civil Engineering and since then Chase has been crushing what little money I have left in my bank account. I've had this account for six years and never have they charged me any type of fees. I was astounded to see that they were taking $6 out of my account every month because 1) I had no job so I had no direct deposit; and 2) I did not have at least $5,000 sitting in my checking account at all times. This didn't make any sense to me. In college I barely ever had more than $100 in my account and most of school I never held a job for any sort of direct deposit to be an issue. After weeks of emails, Chase finally responds to me and tells me of these two specific guidelines and that after five years of college they start to take effect. Ok. I was in school for six years though. Why did you give me an extra year? That was a mistake they said. That shouldn't have happened. So, as the months of unemployment raged on, my bank account became less and less saturated with cash and savings due to the fees. This month I am now -$0.87 in the hole. I have kept all the money I've earned and saved from odd jobs in a cup next to my bed because I can't risk Chase taking any more of it. Yesterday, I was informed that my account has been closed and I have a week to pay them their $0.87.I am much more disappointed and upset than I am angry. The shining white knight I once believed Chase to be has faded into obscurity. I am left now with a greedy money hungry bank that has taken every penny I had (little as it was) and has now closed my account because they are not getting compensated anymore while I wait for a job to come through."},{"date":"2012-12-14","name":"Nicholle Scarbro","user_id":"nicholles1","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"This is my first and favorite credit card.

I'm not really big into them, but they seem like a necessary evil these days, seeing as you need to have a good credit score in order to apply for loans if you want to buy a house or car, etc etc. However, I was surprised how comfortable Chase made me feel when getting this card. I didn't feel like I was being strapped directly into a long term commitment; there are no annual fees which is great for someone like me who rarely uses a credit car to begin with. I also like the cash back option, especially because you get 5% back on various rotating things like gas or groceries (which I already have to buy, so why not save some extra money?) I think that all things considered, the freedom card is a pretty okay credit card if you have to have one, and as long as you keep it paid off, you really won't have any problems. Chase is very straight forward and they don't try to sneak around and scam you with hidden charges.

The points are rewarded depending on what you use the card for. 3 points for Amazon purchases, 2 points for restaurants, grocery stores and gas, and then 1 point for everything else.100 points = 1 dollar. You can use the money pretty much however you want, but I think you have to reach $25 in order to withdraw money. It is tied to you Amazon account, so you can also just use your money right there.

It allows you to pick certain categories where you spend, like entertainment, shopping, and have you pay that upfront with no interest charge.

My banker actually takes the time to sit down and have an honest to goodness talk about the certain rates applicable to my account. I have been a member at various other banks and have found my experience with Chase, even a rather large bank to say the least, to be the fondest. The branch in Arizona that I frequent has always had a personable attitude present in all of the employees. I had my first foray into banking as I reached the age of 18 and I was presented with a laid out format about checking rates and student loan options. I even experienced a withdrawal error and was quickly advised with customer service. The issue was resolved until the day's end.

Points are not worth very much and they don't pile up too fast either, so the 50k points bonus is more than welcome.Okay, next issue. I've had this credit card for about six months now and I don't have too much to complain about it, except for, sometimes, the poor customer relations department. Then, about the bonus system itself, there's not much to be said. You earn between 1 to 5 points per dollar spent, with the mention that you get 5 points only if you shop at Marriott locations, which is not necessarily convenient, but it's alright I guess. All in all, do I recommend this credit card? I'm not sure. I guess it depends on your needs - if you need a credit card with reliable customer service and a strong bonus system, search more. If you just need an 'OK' credit card with an 'OK' bonus system, the Marriott Rewards Premier card is probably the one for you."},{"date":"2012-12-07","name":"John Wie","user_id":"jwie86","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I am not a huge credit card user but whenever I need to - I like to use my Chase Freedom Visa card because of the number of benefits that you will get using it.

The Chase website is very easy to use, is very helpful in organizing and tracking your finances, and researching products. The only thing I find frustrating (occasionally) is the spotty customer service at the branch. Often there are long lines to see the tellers or the advisors and they have definitely been trained to sell you on all they're new products. This can be annoying when you're in a hurry.

Also, I really don't have a habit of carry too much cash around me -- tend to lose the track of them where they go. Charging almost everything to my card is a great and convenient way for me to track my spending in one place.Each quarter this card has several categories of 5% rebate. The upper limit you can charge in those categories is usually at 1500. Some very useful categories are Gasoline, Travel or even online shopping. So if you use it wisely, it is like having a discount of up to $75 on the service you buy. I usually redeem my points with check which is mailed to me through a letter. Sometimes, I redeem my points for other stuff. Last Summer, I had some relatives visiting me and I opted for Sea World tickets which were offered at a discounted price than at the gate.

Another nice benefit of Chase is they have a many account alerts that you can set up to monitor deposits, withdraws, and virtually everything concerning your account. You can have immediate alerts sent to your email or via text message to your cell phone or both. Beyond the account alerts to monitor your account, Chase has strong security for online account access.

When you order something they tell you it can take up to six weeks for the purchase to arrive. So far it has taken about three to four weeks to get the stuff I ordered.

When redeming the points they are so nice and helped us understand the card prossess.

On one hand, if you're a big Disney buff, I think this card is for you. You can redeem the reward points that you get for varous things, but mostly Disney related items. If you spend $500 within the first couple of months, you get a free $100 Disney gift card. I believe that is pretty cool. If you don't want any Disney products, you do earn 2% when shopping at gas stations and places of that nature.

I would say the big drawback is the $100 annual fee, but it could be a lot worse. Believe me, having had a credit hiccup when I was younger, there's nothing quite like getting a reputable card that actually delivers the goods for you! The offer I signed up for also came with a 50,000 point sign up bonus after spending $3,000. When I got to that, I was able to transfer the points and took a nice trip to the U.K. Oh yeah, it is a STYLISH looking card!

We have annual passes to the theme park and try to go at least twice a year to make a weekend getaway out of it and also to visit family in the area. At first I thought this was just going to be a novelty card but it has actually ended up helping us out tremendously. We've earned a ton of points good toward all sorts of Disney related rewards and travel, as well as theme park perks that we wouldn't have gotten otherwise.  There's an annual fee, but for us it makes sense because we get major discounts on the purchases we make at Disney stores and affiliates (10% and more), and we got a $100 bonus after making $500 in purchases (so that essentially paid for the fee for 2 years in and of itself). The points earned on other purchases (like gas, groceries, etc.) are comparable with other cards and nothing to brag about necessarily. But if you are a Disney fan and make regular trips there or to Disney stores (especially if you have little ones) then this card definitely pays off.

Make sure you keep an eye out on what the quarterly 5% bonus is. Usually it will be on gas, groceries, or travel. What I have been most impressed with through Chase is their usability. The mobile app is incredibly easy and intuitive. At one touch you can see your rewards and how much the balance is, at two touched you can pay it off from your checking account, and at three touches you can deposit a check from your living room. The most customization feature however is the alerts. I like to pay may bills through automatic payments, but I get worried they didn't go through. With the alerts set up, chase will send me a text whenever my credit card registers a charge for certain amounts. That way I know exactly when the cable gets paid off!

First thing I used it for was to take out a cash advance of $500 I desperately needed for my rent. Also, they have a promotion where if you spend $500 in your first three months they give you $100 cash back, although I found out it doesn't apply for cash advances. So what I did was to transfer a balance I had on a different card (from wells fargo) into that card. I transferred $720, it took a few days and they charge me a small fee, but I'm going to have $100 deducted from my Chase Freedom card!

I have led many mission trips for church, usually consisting of multiple vehicles driving long distances.  I use my credit card to fill up the vehicles each time to make it easy to keep records.

I did tried to take advantage of any cash back offers and points that I was given, unfortunately, for some reason, I was making what I thought were 'smart' choices, only to find out that many of my purchases didn't qualify for points or cash back because I didn't use certain merchants or use my credit in the right category. Chase was not too kind in dealing with my issue and did nothing to remedy the situation for me.As a result of my bad experience, I decided to give the card a rest and try to not use it unless I absolutely had to. So, after about six months or so, I had to use it to get my car fixed, and I was rejected. I couldn't understand why since I had no balance. I called Chase and they told me that due to inactivity, my credit limit had been reduced and that at that time I did not qualify for an increase, for reasons they did not give to me.

Sometimes they are for movies, department stores, and home improvement stores which I don't visit frequently enough to value the rewards.  Other times though, they will be for gas, hotels, and flights, which is really helpful in saving money for large transactions, even if it is only 5 cents per dollar.  I think this credit card is decent and the APR isn't terrible, although I do pay off the card every month.

But then something strange happened with the card. I was traveling overseas and planned to rent a car. I presented the card to the rental car company and they refused it because the design of the card would not fit into their card machine. For some reason, the name and numbers on the Slate card are printed in a different place than on most cards, and this made it impossible for them to imprint my information at the rental car place.

How could it be closed? She said that because of my Bank of America card balance being high, Chase cancelled my card. Needless to say it had a balance of $440 and was not at the limit.

The bonus points are well worth getting the card for if you plan on spending that 3000, which is honestly a very easy thing to do if you use it as your primary card. I've personally never had a problem with the card thankfully so I can't really comment on how they handle things like identity theft or unwanted purchases.

The rebates they offer on purchases is pretty nice too! 5% on many things that change each annual quarter and 1% on everything all the time. So I charge everything now. Cash is obsolete for me any more! The categories change every 3 months so keeping up with what the current one is is a bit of a hassle, but definitely worth it!

All in all, I think my amazon.com purchases and restaurant expenses make up the majority of my spending each month.  That's why this card is good because I will get either 3% or 2% on every dollar I spend unrelated to rent and bills.

One of the best things I love about this card is probably the 5% cash back program that they have. The 5% program is good in that it gives 5% cash back for some of the things you're most likely to buy during that quarter. For example, during the summer it gives you 5% cash back on airfare or gas. And, around Christmas, the people of Chase know that you'll be more likely to shop more, so you get more cash back on department stores and the likes. For items that do not qualify for the 5% cash back, there is always the 1% cash back. Also, thought it's always better to pay your card in full, sometimes it just doesn't happen, in those cases, this card is awesome in that, in comparison to other cards, the interest rates are not nearly as brutal. Another plus, is that there are no annual fees for all these great benefits!Something else I should probably mention (yes, another positive!), when you sign up for the card there are always bonuses! When I signed up, there was a $100 cash back for $500 spent in the first 3 months. But, on sites like Slickdeals, I've seen offers of as high as $300 cash back for $500 spent in the first 3 months.

I\u2019ve bought a couple of nice computers  thanks to my high credit limit, and paid off the card immediately for a quick cash bonus.One tip I\u2019d offer that some people might not think about: This card gives you several choices for redeeming points. You can redeem them for an Amazon credit, apply the points to your credit card balance, or even have a checked mailed straight to you. At face value, those options might seem pretty equal, but they aren\u2019t! If you take the first option, you can buy more cool stuff at Amazon, but you won\u2019t get bonus points for the purchase.

This card has awesome cash back feature. When I opened the credit card in a Chase Bank branch they gave me 1000 points (100 points=$1). For every $1 spent, it gives 1 point. For every transaction, it gives 10 point. For every $10 spent, it gives 1 point. What I try to do is use this for all sorts of transactions, preferably small transactions like buying eggs, milk which are typically $2- $3 transactions. For that I get 12-13 points. In this way if you spent about $100, you will get about 400-450 points from such small transactions. That is approximately 4% cash back. Also there are select categories, which change quarterly, from which you can get 5% cash backs. They contribute a lot to your total points. In a month I typically get about 20-30 points. Last month I went to Niagara and spent about $1900 that month. I got 4000 points and $40 as cash back.

It's similar to a lot of other cards, not as much of a reward as some of the more exclusive cards offer, but it's definitely a nice bonus because that 500 was reached in the first two months of using it on purchases I had to make anyway. The incredibly cool thing about the card is that every quarter they change what the 5% reward applies to. If you're at all familiar with cash back rewards you'll know that 5 is exceedingly high and other cards approach 3 or so on specific purchases. The only drawback is that if you're juggling a lot of cards this is just one more card to have in mind and know what card you have to break out for whatever which purchase you happen to be making. The only drawback is the below average rate this card gets on purchases that aren't the favored 5% types currently going, which is why if you're good at juggling card balances this is something that will add to your tool kit of cash back cards, but definitely won't end up replacing all of them.

When I was around 20, I applied for my first credit card, which was a big mistake. My interest rates were jacked up every single month, and I was in debt over my head. After the incident, I spent years not owning a single credit card. The only card that I used was a prepaid one, that didn\u2019t require a contract. In recent months, I had a yearning to try out an actual credit card again. I can honestly say that I am now a proud customer of Chase Sapphire Visa. One of my favorite benefits from this card is that, when I travel to other countries, I get no transaction fee. I am a frequent traveler so I really benefit and save some cash this way. I get lots of bonus points as well, so that is very helpful, especially when I travel and need some extra cash.

We've been happy with our ability to get cash advances as well, when it has come to emergencies (like a vet bill), along with when we were a little short for our vacation.

It lets you set up a schedule of paying off the entire balance or certain purchases. Blueprint will show you how much you will need to pay each month to achieve your goal.

It has a rewards program (Ultimate Rewards). Base reward is 1% on all purchases, but there are quarterly categories that will earn 5% cash back on up to $1,500, though you have to sign up each quarter to get the 5%. You can get rewards as either cash back, or as gift cards or items. 2,000 points gets $20 cashback, gift cards seem to use the same ratio (2,500 points = $25 gift card). Not a bad rewards program at all if you're one to pay the balance in full each month.

Gasoline purchases reward a higher rate, perhaps 2 or 3 points per dollar spent. Purchases on amazon.com itself, however, reward something like 5 points per dollar spent. The points equal a penny each and can be spent only on Amazon. I think the system is adequate, since there is no annual fee. I would like to see a lower interest rate, however.

I use this for my small business, so a lot of company purchases go through it and we primarily use the rewards for paying for company travel.  The 20% off on airfare is huge for us when we need to book a couple tickets to a convention.  You normally get 2% back on dining and other travel expenses, and a standard 1% back on all other purchases.  If you travel a lot, this might be the card for you.  But if you don't, then you might be better off getting another card that will give you more cash back on stuff like groceries.  It also has an annual fee, but you'll easily save that in travel if you use it often.The initial bonus is also huge!

The security on it is very high which is need these days to protect yourself. Also their customer services is awesome. To me there's nothing worse than having to be on the phone hours with customer service just to find out the guy your talking to doesn't know what he's talking about.

You can get rewards as either cash back, or as gift cards or items. 2,000 points gets $20 cash back, gift cards seem to use the same ratio (2,500 points = $25 gift card). Not a bad rewards program at all if you're one to pay the balance in full each month.

However, either due to their warm advertising campaign or the fact that not much really changed, I quickly trusted Chase and felt even more confident with them than with Washington Mutual. The products and services stayed the same, just reissued as Chase instead of Washington Mutual, the branches I used had a facelift, and most of the staff stayed the same (from what I could tell).It wasn\u2019t until just enough time went by after the takeover that I received information about changes to my account, that maintenance fees would now apply if I couldn\u2019t meet specific guidelines.

While I did find myself using my card more often (using my card to fill up gas in my mother's car, even if she did give me cash), I still would pay the amount in full after the billing cycle completed.  Not too long after, I had built up $200 in rewards and at the time, Chase offered a $50 bonus if you cashed out $200 in rewards, earning me a nice $250 check.

You really can't top that.I didn't have to do anything different, I didn't change any of my shopping habits, I wasn't spending more money as I was being reimbursed for additional charges from other people... and Chase rewarded me for it.

I did get the $30 Credit to my account after approval. So that is not a scam. It was a nice bonus to see! I make sure to keep my balance paid off on this card, because of the interest rate.

My APR has fluctuated or gone up for no unfair reason.  Also, customer service is pretty reliable.  Once, I made a payment on the due date after 8PM and didn\u2019t know that it must be before 8PM to not be delinquent.  I was charged a late fee and called chase customer service.

Also, my father is a veteran currently serving overseas. As such he falls under the Military Relief Act, which allowed him to send out notices of his deployment, in which case the credit companies must lower their interest rates. Chase complied with this law as if doing him a favor, only to cancel his account one week later based upon a \u201creview\u201d of said account. I don\u2019t know what Chase has against servicemen but before this they also tried messing with his mortgage while he was in Afghanistan.

I liked that I got a $100 statement credit after first use. That $100 helped a lot with ticket purchasing for the parks! Another perk, since I am a big Disney fan is the ability to earn 1%-2% in Disney dollars. I was able to choose my design for my card, too. There weren't too many designs, but it was fun being able to pick my own. Another benefit is that since I am a big Disney fan is that I saved 10% off when I shopped and spent over $50 at Disney stores! It is like using a \"coupon\" by getting 10% back and I love my coupons. Disney World also has Card member locations for Meet N' Greets! There are other rewards, too that can be beneficial to others. However, the ones that I mentioned are what have made me enjoy this card when I use it. I try to pay my balance off every time there is one, so I don't use this card very often. I also recently called Customer Service and was able to get my question answered quickly and not given the run around.

The rewards we like to get and have for the past year are free movies(Lisa's Favorite), gift cards, and even paid off the bill towards our Hawaii trip.

I was very sure that I had not received any bill from this credit card, and I totally forgot the money I spent with this card several months ago (which was only 20 something dollars). The late fee penalty was higher than the initial discount I got. I called the credit card customer service and tried to ask them to waive the late fee since I had not received a statement from them. Apparently they sent the statement to a wrong address. However, the late fee was not waived and my credit score was lowered. Being very pissed off, I canceled the card immediately and so have never wanted it again, although I am now shopping more frequently on Amazon.

Chase has provided me with the absolute worst experience with any money or banking system in my entire life. At first glance, the staff looked great. They were more than willing to help me and made me very comfortable with opening up an account with this company. However, that is where the positive aspects all ended. I at first thought that the whole application process was very simple and fast and easy. However, within days of opening my account, it was closed. I called to inquire what had happened. After waiting on the telephone for more than an hour, all they told me was that I should be receiving a letter in the mail with all the information that I needed. So I had already gotten my card and soon after received another letter from them in the mail. The letter basically told me they closed my account because they had the right to do so. My only way to then solve this was to go directly to one of their branches in person. I went within the next couple of days. Finally I was able to resolve everything, and with no explanation. I got all of my money back and switched banks.

Since I use my credit card to pay off bills it was easy to earn 40K points in three months, not including any of the points I earned in the meantime. I have used this bank for three years and had this card for about two. I have already taken advantage of the points I earned and booked a few nights at a hotel during my vacation without a hitch.

We had two checking accounts...our personal and our business account...(as well as a couple of credit cards) with Washington Mutual, which Chase gobbled up a few years ago when all the big banks seemed to be taking over the small ones. Washington Mutual was GREAT! Their tellers and customer service employees were helpful and courteous, and we NEVER had a problem with them. Then Chase muscles their way in and BAM! EVERYTHING did a 180! Suddenly their tellers were all replaced in our branch and they were sullen and curt (they probably hated working there). The one time I had need to call customer service was an absolute nightmare! On hold for over half an hour and being shunted from one person to the other...it was ridiculous! By the time I finally did get to the person who could help with my problems, she was rather snotty and would not listen to me. She just kept jabbering on and on and on whatever the corporate line was, cutting me off in mid-sentence and telling me that the problem I was having couldn't possibly exist. That was the LAST straw. We pulled BOTH our checking account money out (but are still stuck with Chase for our credit cards that originated with Washington Mutual). When we did, the branch manager wanted to know why and who we were transferring to...in detail. I told her my story about the customer service debacle and informed her in no uncertain terms that WHERE we were taking our money was absolutely NONE of her business (we moved it to a GREAT credit union that, sadly, can't be reviewed on this site).

While it isn't the best for making your every day purchases since you only get 1% back (which is a standard these days), Chase offers up to 5% back in select categories.  The only catch is that you have to sign in through their website and basically activate those bonus rewards every 3 months.  This card is great if you are using it only for those categories.  In Q1 this year you could get the 5% back at Amazon and Gas Stations, Q2 was grocery stores, Q3 right now is restaurants, and Q4 will be Best Buy, Hotels and Airlines.  If you are looking to maximize your rewards, this card can definitely give you a bonus in those categories.  You really just need to remember to activate the rewards every quarter and then break the habit of using your regular card for the next 3 months.

I got this card before UA and CO were merged, so I have another Chase credit card for Continental. Both cards offered me some sign-in bonus mileages.For one period of time in the past I traveled a lot and I exclusively took UA flights. I had been using this card for almost every purchase, simply to accumulate the mileage. However, recently I have stopped using this card for two reasons: First, I got a Chase Sapphire Preferred card which provided a generous 50k mileage, which can be equally transferred to my UA mileage account. Chase Sapphire provided the same point return for purchase as the United MileagePlus card. However, the Chase Sapphire points can be transferred to any UA mileage account for free, which is very convenient. On the other hand, if I want to transfer my UA mileage to others I have to pay a large amount of money. Second, in recent years, the UA service has deteriorated and it seems there are plenty of UA mileage floating on the market, which significantly increases the amount of mileage points to redeem a flight ticket. I remember four years ago it was easy to book an international round trip ticket with 65k mileages for any time period. Nowadays, it is almost impossible to find such a deal and usually 65k mileages can only be redeemed for a one-way trip ticket. I have stopped using the United MileagePlus card for a while, but haven't decided whether or not to cancel it, since I am still flying with UA and have a Premier Gold status. Probably before the next time the annual fee is due, I will cancel this card."},{"date":"2012-07-25","name":"Jennifer Carlyle","user_id":"metallic361","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I have had a Chase Sapphire Card for about a year now and use it frequently.

I was able to use that $40 to get premium grade brake rotors for my truck FOR FREE!  A seller on Amazon had them listed for dirt cheap.  I earn 1 point for every dollar spent on the card.  I use the card to pay the ridiculous bill for my cable service and cell phone service each month. I also earn 2 points every time I use the card for gas or dinner at a restaurant.  The points QUICKLY add up, and they are easily exchanged for cash back and gift cards.  If you are someone that shops a lot on Amazon, you should definitely use this card to shop.  You will get 3 points for every dollar you spend on Amazon.  This may not seem like a lot, but you'll be in great shape if you spend and pay off consistently.

My only problem came over the holidays through the New Year when I was visiting home from college and some things were charged to my account way too early by several automatic withdrawals and I was charged 30 dollars for every small automatic withdrawal, ($5 dollars for razor, $22 for acne meds, and a bunch of other small automatic charges that I have that were charged 2 days early) leaving me $250 dollars poorer because I couldn't deposit money because there I only one ATM in all of Hawaii for Chase and after driving all the way there after it was falsely listed as having a cash deposit function. They were able to absorb a good amount of the charges after calling, but still I was out $60. Another problem came again here in Hawaii, my debit card suddenly became unusable and when I called to see what the problem was, they told me it would be simple to fix if I could just come into a branch to verify my identity, but I was going to be in Hawaii for 3 months, where there are no branches, upon asking them for alternatives, they said there were none. Luckily I had just received my first credit card and I can still pay my bill using my checking account online, otherwise I would have had next to no access to my money for three months. I ordered a new debit card and finally received it 12 business days after after it was expected, but upon calling the activation line on the card, it never asked me to set a pin to activate it and a pin was required to call about that card when it didn't work either so I had to call about 6 times before I could find a set of options that would lead me to a customer service representative without having to input a pin that I didn't have. Overall, I probably wouldn't have these problems if I didn't travel so much with the military, but they did give me a free premium account because of the military, and that is probably the only reason I refrain from joining the military banking system of USAA, I enjoy the perks that come with the better account."},{"date":"2012-07-24","name":"Geoff Son","user_id":"wellnessrat3","verified":false,"product":"Chase Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I have had a College Chase account for a few years now.

Within 10 minutes my old card was deactivated and a week later I received a new card in the mail. I only had one bad experience with a particular branch, which is why I give it 4 stars and not 5. When I was first opening up my account as a college student they swindled me into applying for a credit card, claiming that it was really a card aimed toward college students and \"no one\" was ever rejected. After I applied I overheard the representative talking to his co worker about how I would probably get rejected. I was ultimately rejected for the card but I did not appreciate being lied to.

Each time someone always greets me, and customer services gets me through very quickly and efficiently. One thing that I had never noticed before becoming a Chase checking member is how many different ATM and branch locations there are. I went to the gas station one day and while waiting in line I was planning the rest of my route. My next stop was to get cash from a branch or ATM. I exit the line and see an ATM right by the exit in the gas station! The only reason I can't give Chase 5 stars is the mortgage department has a little work to do.

Once my account was flagged for 'suspicious' activity - it was only me buying a Google deal, but I appreciate the fact that they actually seem to be actively policing my account. Their app is easy to use and VERY convenient to have. I do have two issues with Chase - first, I believe they have branches in every major city...except Albany, NY, which is ONLY the capital of the Empire State. I don't understand why the city where my state governor resides and governs from is NOT a major city, but perhaps some will be placed there soon.

I can't speak for a lot of their services, as my setup with them is very bare-bones. I opened my account online (nice and easy, by the way), never even ordered checks. It did take them forever to get my debit card to me, though.

I have been the owner of a Chase card for many years, and never had a problem.  While I was in college (the first time), I racked up a bit of student loans, just like everyone else in my situation.  During that time, I rarely used my Chase card in anything but emergencies.  I made sure to keep a small balance I paid off month to month, just for the sake of credit.  My limit was high enough to serve my purposes, but I never got anywhere near it, so I rarely paid much attention to it.  Upon graduating, I was faced with what to do about paying off my loans.  This is where Chase comes in.  Over those years of school, they had been gradually raising my limit.  By the time I had graduated, I had more than enough to cover my entire student loan amount, and the interest rate was lower than I could get anywhere else.  I should also mention that this was after the deferment period as well.Beyond that, they have been more than willing to work with me in the rare case of a late payment.  When my identity was stolen, they alerted me to suspicious activity right away and allowed me to catch stuff early.Like I said, mainly positive.

I always pay off the entire balance each month to avoid interest.  Even if I decided not to pay off the entire balance each month, the minimum payment is low and the APR is very reasonable.  I love that there is no annual fee as well.  The best part about this card is that you get $1 in Disney rewards for every $100 you spend.  In the past month, I've made $20 just for using the card on things I'd purchase anyway!  Another plus is the cute design.  There are several designs to choose from.  I ordered the same design for my husband and myself, but he decided it was a little too girly.  So, he called customer service and they shipped a new card to him with the design of his choice.  It was simple.  Customer service is really great and the website to pay our bill is very organized and easy to use.   I also love that I can check our Disney rewards balance at any time.

My one negative experience was my card information being stolen (I have no idea how; I only shop at secure sites and at stores in person), and this was handled well by Chase card services.

Largely because as you mentioned, if someone like you put out lawsuits, the damage from that action is far greater than cheating someone of 1-2k dollars. What often happens in fraud cases, is they will withhold ALL charges. This includes legitimate ones as well as fraudulent ones. As such, when the bill is posted, you have paid a lot less money than what you should have (since legit ones are also withheld, and doesn't reflex the actual spending). Once investigation is complete, they will remove fraudulent ones, and which they did, did they not? Chase is great at responding to your needs in this regard, and not many banks make it this easy. But after they got rid of fraudulent ones, they will post the legit ones, to which you have to pay for. This is what I suggest you go through one more time to verify actual spending and payment. You obviously summed up all spends, now go to your bank's website and see how much money you have paid in total. If that discrepancy still exists, then you should show that to Chase, and they will respond to that."},{"date":"2012-07-18","name":"Chris Wilson","user_id":"cdub571","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I've had several credit cards before applying for the Chase Freedom card, but never really cared enough to try to utilize cashback or rewards programs.

I think my specific branch has way too many security issues to count...which is obviously a concern.  Other than this the people are always friendly, and other services and fees are reasonable.  However security is obviously the main concern of banking, so this is a big issue. If you can't trust your bank to keep your money and identity safe, then what is really the point of having a bank in the first place?  The problem lies in that these places have information about everything important identity wise; personal information, address, social security number, bank account number, financial history, credit card information.  That's a lot of responsibility and it is important to find someone who can handle all of that and make sure it is kept safe.  I guess that is my only gripe, but this should really not be an issue for such a big bank to begin with.  I know several people at my branch that have had their identity stolen in the last year, myself included.  That's not a very satisfying idea.

I bank with Chase because I was formerly a customer of WaMu, and decided to keep my account with Chase. Remembering back to how my old account at WaMu was, the terms on Chase accounts are much more punishing, but they are definitely in line with other competing banks (all the big ones).The only way to get perhaps 30% or so lower fees would be to go with a credit union. There are drawbacks and benefits to both, the main drawback of credit unions being that they aren't on literally every street corner, and the main drawback of big banks being, well, they're big banks, and they want to make money. I'm glad I stayed with Chase because it means I get to bank literally everywhere they are, which is just about every 4 blocks, and I've never run into any problems with my account. I am very proactive about checking my accounts, as any account holder should be.Read the fine print before signing anything, make sure to always stay above your account minimums, and make sure to call the bank right away in case of any issues.

As has been mentioned, Chase can and will cut credit limits if you don't use the card consistently. I had it happen to me and after a little negotiating with a customer service rep, my full credit line was restored. To avoid carrying a large balance on this card, I make frequent payments online, usually once weekly, for purchases I made the preceding week.  In the past I found it was far too easy to use a card for all of my gas or grocery purchases and then get socked with a giant bill at the end of the month when I had spent the \u201cextra\u201d money in my checking account on other things. I do like that the card is basically fee-free and I can earn cash back bonuses ranging from a minimal 1% on up to 10% when shopping at certain online retailers through Chase. Perhaps surprisingly, I have found several good deals through the Chase network of online retailers and look their first when shopping online.  5% cash back bonuses are given on categories that rotate every three months and I can usually manage to snag a good amount that way as well.

There was an automated phone system when I first made my call, but I did not have to be passed through an unreasonable amount of choices before speaking with a customer service representative.I take advantage of the automatic payment service so that I never have to worry about late fees.  The payment is withdrawn from my checking account on a monthly basis.  If I want to pay more on the account, I can easily go online and make another payment.  The website is very easy to navigate.  It provides up to date account information whenever I need it.Overall, I am very satisfied with Chase Bank.

You either choose a credit card that tailors to you, or choose one that ends up just taking your money without you getting anything out of it. Everyone who gets a card pays for it in the end, but if you get one that's perfect for you (This one for Disney fans), you still get things in return for using it. Some cards out there don't offer you anything and have an insane APR or annual fee, and this card has neither of those while still servicing you in any way you see fit.

I still find my local bankers to be very helpful and friendly every time I go in. Phone banking also provides a good level of service and Chase has really been on top of it when it comes to detecting potential and, in one case, real fraud on my account. They are cautious but not overly restrictive and haven't caused me any problems even though I travel extensively. One of the best things about Chase is its extensive network of ATMs and the ability to make deposits via a smartphone app. They seem committed to innovation and making banking easy on the customer. They are not pushy or sales oriented when you come into the bank, unlike my previous bank. I also like the online interface that integrates my credit card and bank account.Instances when my local Chase branch has been less than helpful have been when I needed foreign currency and to obtain some rather complex account documents to verify my account in order to apply for a foreign visa. In the first instance, I found the staff rather dismissive and in the second, I was referred to a private banker (not sure what they're called, but the people who sit at the desks) who had no idea what he was doing but all the confidence in the world.

As a resident of NY, ATM and branch availability is beyond excellent.  There is essentially one on every corner.  The signup process was simple and fast.  I had a few minor issues, which were all resolved.  One was an issue with a check deposit through an ATM; the ATM ate the check without depositing it.  A simple call to customer service resolved this in a day.  The other issue was with a seemingly random hold on a payroll check that lasted over a week.  This was a bit more of an issue, and took a bit of escalation to get worked out.Since then, however, it's been a trouble free experience.  The online banking service is simple, easy to use, and uncluttered.  They make paperless options easy to sign up for, which I am a huge fan of.  The first time you sign into the online banking service, it prompts you to select whether you wish to enroll in overdraft protection or decline coverage.

Signing up for the checking\/savings account is very simple, but then again I've never had a problem at any bank, so I guess that just falls into the category of not being terrible. Anyway, the easy riding ended there. Chase's customer support is absolutely horrible. The staff are extremely rude (on the phone, they're OK in the actual bank). But rude is tolerable, most places you call into (except TiVo, but hey, that's a DVR company, not a bank) are pretty rude; but in addition to being rude to you they are totally clueless about, well, practically anything they should know. If you ask even the most basic question they will either transfer you or put you on an exceedingly long hold only to come back (or be picked up by) with no answers at all. It seems like their tactics revolve around spinning you in circles until you give up. Poor business practice if you ask me.

BEFORE you proceed to spam the \"apply\" button, It's important to note what you can get out of Avios (British Airline Mileage term).    The fact is... Not much. It's because flying to and from europe on British Airline on award ticket (using your avios) is going to cost you ransom, both in Avios points but ALSO IN TAX!  A flight from New York City to London cost around $900 TAX when you use your points. wait? $900 dollars for tax? When I could pay for an economy seat for about $1000?   900?  really?So when is Avios good for?  It's if you are a flight connoisseur and you want to fly first class no matter what.  Then, you could drop 180,000 avios and pay $2000 in tax, and fly first class to london.  Worth it for most people? no.    (there is another trick where u can use avios to hop around south america locations, but that's not for everyone). So, my word of advice? stay away from this card.

(If, and only if, saver seats are available).\n2) However, reading the fine print, for most people who will apply to this card via WalletHub will only get 50k points (they would have to spend $20,000 first year to get full 100k avios. ) \n\nAvios, in my opinion, is best when you fly short distance (as the charge of avios is distance based), and you can find some incredible value intra South America via LAN airline.  \n\nAward availability on American Metal with BA avios is also limited, so you would have to consider that factor as well.  \n\nFinally, if this card was from anyone BUT chase,  i would apply in a heart beat.

For the most part, I've been very satisfied with this credit card.  Frequent shoppers on Amazon.com benefit the most from this credit card, however.  That is because of the credit card's point system.  For every dollar you spend, you earn a point.  For every dollar you spend at gas stations, restaurants, and drugstores, you earn two points.  For every dollar you spend on Amazon.com, however, you earn three points.  These points can then be redeemed for credit on Amazon.com.  (For every 100 points, you get a $1.00 towards your purchase.)  Redeeming these points for credit on Amazon.com is pretty easy and you can do it any time, regardless of your points total.  If you want to redeem your points for anything besides a credit on Amazon.com, then your options are more limited.  There are other options such as cash back, but in order to redeem these offers, you have to reach a certain amount of points.  This is a drawback of the Amazon credit card.  The point system is inflexible and if you're not a big shopper on that site and have nothing to buy in particular, the points are not as useful.  The customer service has been solid.  The web site is also very easy to use. The credit card is issued by Chase, which I think is a positive.  I find that Chase has good security measures in place to protect its customers.

I have two credit cards: a Wells Fargo student credit card issued when I opened an account when I turned 18 and enrolled in college and a Visa Freedom card that I have used for almost a year now. I rarely (if ever) even touch my Wells Fargo card. I mainly used it to build credit, but there were no rewards or cashback associated with the card. After doing some research, I decided to apply for a Chase Visa Freedom card. I\u2019m currently a graduate student on a tight budget, so I was looking for something with minimal or no fees and decent rewards or cashback. When I signed up, Chase was offering $250 cashback if $500 was spent in the first 3 months. I\u2019ve seen the same deal be offered since I signed up for between $200-300, so keep your eyes peeled! Between gas, utilities, and groceries, the $500 spending in 3 months was super easy to achieve.The rewards are only 1% for most purchases, but the 5% rotating categories usually manage to hit something that I spend each month (I believe the next three months it will be for gas stations, while the previous 3 were for groceries). Additionally, since Visa is accepted almost everywhere I have never had an issue with card rejection. Between the initial bonus cashback and 1-5% rewards, I\u2019d estimate that using the Chase Freedom Card has put an extra ~$400 in my pocket over the last year alone while not requiring me to pay any extra fees or change my spending habits.I\u2019m extremely happy with this card.

When I initially got the card I really liked the rewards program: 5% cash back on your top 3 categories and 1% on the rest. I would rack up rewards quickly and redeem $50 within 2 months. However, since they changed to specified categories that rotate I have become less likely to used this card.

It's a really basic credit card with a minor cash back program for stuff one would actually buy. It's really nice for people who want to start building their credit without the hassle of using a card with a lot of stipulation. But of course, the main reason I got this card is for the initial cash back bonus. Luckily for me, I was able to get the $300 Bonus cash back instead the $200 cash back after spending $500. Basically that's you're spending $500 for only $200.Outside of this cash back initial bonus, the regular cash back program is really small, but not insignificant. Having a 1% cash back bonus is nice especially if you make a lot of purchases, but there are better credit cards that give a high % cash back. However, there is a quarterly 5% cash back bonus on certain purchases. For example, during this summer quarter, you can get 5% on gas purchases which is really nice. You do have to sign up (simple activation online) every quarter, but you can get email remainders. Even if you activate later than the start date, Chase will retroactively apply the cash back to eligible purchases you've made beforehand. The drawbacks is that there is no 0% interest rates."},{"date":"2012-07-03","name":"Allen Thomas","user_id":"allent17","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"After several credit cards and looking at all the competition, my wife and I decided to try Chase.

The $100 \"at sign up\" is great, nice little $ on the side but you do have to spend a little bit in the first 3 months.

The old bonus system was much more versatile, making it a true \"freedom\" card, since you could use it anywhere and at least be guaranteed a reasonable bonus. The 5% rotating rewards are fine, but it is confusing to keep track of which categories are getting bonuses in a given month. It is definitely not a use everywhere card.

So far, I love it! This card was a good fit for me from the start. The first thing I did was a balance transfer from another card (which was charging me about 26% interest). This made a huge difference on my monthly payments. The best thing is I can look forward to paying 0% on the funds I transferred over for the next year (I qualified for an offer of 0% on the first 15 months!). The next thing that caught my interest was the $100 cash back offer. Reaching the $500 minimum in purchases within the first three months in order to qualify for the cash back was not a problem for me. I travel quite a bit (mostly by car) and rack up a lot of business travel related expenses. This is another reason the Freedom card has been great for me-business expenses! I spend so much money on gas and food and there are frequent %5 cash back bonus offers on these items. Though, regardless of what the extra current bonus offer is, I always earn at least 1%. In 4 months I have racked up a ton of cash back rewards.  I can hardly wait to check my reward balance at the end of every month.

Everything gives you at least 1% which is nice I guess. Sometimes I wish I would have gotten a card that gave you a flat 2 or 3% back but I guess at the end of the year it equals about the same so its not a big deal.

The tellers are always jovial and courteous, and they also make sure my needs are taken care of.  Second, is their phone customer service.  The automated service always gives me a direct option of talking to a representative, rather than pushing one key after another and wasting a chunk of my time.  The wait is not frustratingly long, and my needs are taken care of every time; there is no waiting.  Lastly, there are scarcely any mistakes on my monthly statements.

The biggest complaint that I have about Chase is their fee schedule and constant changes. I have been lucky enough to have a free checking account since I became a customer, but I have not found the changes to affect morale and opinion of their customers.

Again, thanks, guys.Fast forward to 6 months later, May 2012, I finally received my card, very useful.Bottom line is, in the U.S., Chase's services are pristine. You call, they answer, even though you're talking to a call center representative bases in a country where a Chase branch does not exist, they try their best and take their time to talk you through the process of online banking, even give you tutorials on clearing your cookies cache.

I've had other rewards credit cards before, but it was alway much more of a struggle for me to decide which questionable items I should use my points toward. It's much easier now that I have the Amazon card because I can use my points on the same great website I find myself ordering multiple things a month from. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with my Amazon.com Chase card.

I don't use it for non-Amazon purchases however, only for things I purchase on Amazon. Over the course of a few years I've gotten over 150 in rewards cards from Amazon.com. Although the reward is just gift card that's redeemable on only Amazon, it's super easy to find something you need to buy.

I also played the Wheel of Fortune game at Sony.com, but when I found out that Chase Freedom gives you better rewards plus have bonus categories each month I was immediately sold. The bonus cash back upon signing up for the card was a great added bonus as well. I'm very happy with this card and prefer it over my 2 other cards. I would give it 5 stars because I use it for every purchase, pay it off in full each month, and gain about $50 in cash back each month. The interest rate doesn't bother me one bit because I pay it off in full. The credit limit isn't that big of a deal to me because I don't spend that much without paying it off. With the rewards, the months that they give you 5% cash back for gas and groceries are especially helpful. I also think that Chase's website is easy to use to pay your bill, view your statements, and understand all aspects of the card. Chase customer service has also been great to me on the 2 occasions that I needed to talk to someone over the phone.

This card is decent if you are a regular Amazon.com shopper, but otherwise you can earn more cash back with other cards. You earn 3 points per dollar on Amazon.com purchases, 2 points at Restaurants and Gas Stations and 1 point everywhere else. The points can be redeemed as low as 2,500 for a $25 Amazon.com gift certificate. I believe you can also use the points on Amazon.com as they accumulate. They do have decent customer service (through Chase) and responded quickly and with lots of details when I had a question about an interest rate charge.

No one besides myself knows it is a prepaid, and I never have to worry about whether I have the funds available for a purchase. I just have my paycheck loaded onto it, and I'm good to go. I have talked with customer service twice since I have had the card, and they have always been very professional and helpful. There was one time when my balance did not match up with what my deposit had been, and they were able to resolve the issue right away (it was an error at my employer's, not with Chase). An additional benefit is that there are so many Chase ATM's around my area, I never had to worry about paying a fee at an ATM.

Since I use my card for everything, the online transaction history is nice for my records and saving all those receipts are not necessary any more. The online payment is very easy and the email reminders are great. I pay my card in full every month but the 0% intro is a nice safety net. I bet if I called up I could get my interest rate lowered after some time using the card after the intro time period is up.

It's got the somewhat convenient payment plan setup which I haven't used extensively. This does look handy though in the event that I get myself into a reasonable amount of debt. I've never gone over my Slate's limit (not even close, actually), but I've used it quite a bit for purchases like appliances and in situations where I didn't have cash. Chase's website is pretty easy to use and makes checking my balance easy.

I always deposit my checks at the Bank ATM machine because of their quick service and digital prints of the checks that I thought were great.  On my usual routine, I went in my local Chase bank and was in the process of depositing my check when it jammed and spit out a receipt that gave me an error code.  Now the jamming was not the problem, but when I went and talked to a teller he told me that they had to give corporate a call.  After an hour went by, they told me that everything should be okay and my money should be their in good faith and until they check with the ATM machine.  After several months have gone by and thinking that the problem was resolved, I see a 1820.00 was deducted from my account.  Not initially knowing what was wrong, I called Chase and they told me that they never found a check and that they had the right to reverse any deposit. Now at this point I was furious because I had lost 1820.00 from my account and they never told me about the 3 months period in which they could reverse it.  After complaining and giving them evidence, from paper slips and going back to the bank, they finally reverse after threatening them with a lawsuit.  I finally learned to never trust ATM machines, but to know that Chase does not have your interest, but to maintain a high profit margin."},{"date":"2012-06-25","name":"Blake","user_id":"blake0312","verified":false,"product":"Chase Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I have been a member of Chase Checking for over two years now as a student and I have had zero problems thus far.

They gave me $150 for singing up for a new account, and my wife $150 for her account as well.  The checking is absolutely free as long as one of us has a direct deposit associated with our account, which is not an issue at all.  We also get 100% free checks!  This is great, as our last bank made us pay for them, and then we had to keep paying for them when we got married and her name changed, and again when we moved.The thing I love most about Chase is their mobile banking.  I have an app on my iPhone which lets me cash my checks without going to a physical branch, and it shows up in my account within an hour!  I honestly feel like I'm living in the future.  I get so many checks in the mail for $2 or $3 for things I do online, so the time this has saved me has been amazing!  The website interface is really slick and easy to use too, I never have an issue finding what tool I need to pay a bill or make a transaction.ATMs are also plentiful with Chase.

There have been good times and bad times with them so far.  I have had my Debit Card cancelled on me three times while traveling due to me not informing them prior to traveling.  I understand that it was my fault for not informing prior to traveling but it took them 18 days to figure out I was using my card in Europe and not in Washington state before I received a declined card the first time.  I thought over 2 weeks was a long time for them to not act on what they believed were fraudulent charges.  But that was almost 3 years ago and I believe they have streamlined that now.  Last time I left the state and drove 30 hours straight I got a call midway through Colorado asking me about my last charges.As for any other issues, they are extremely quick to respond.  It is very easy to call up and get customer support, billing info, balance, etc.  And they are quite knowledgeable, at least up here, at the walk-in area and quick to help.

You get one percent back per dollar spent and then each quarter there a few categories that you can get five percent back.  These categories typically include airfare, gas, restaurants, groceries, etc, so they are relevant categories.

And while one would have to believe there is a catch to this offer, the only thing I can think of at the moment is that if you close your card before your account membership anniversary, you don\u2019t get the 50% rewards bonus, which would make this a rather pedestrian 1% cash back card."},{"date":"2012-06-21","name":"Johnathan Mitchell","user_id":"johnathan.mitchell.313","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"After being a user of MasterCard for years, I finally made the switch to Chase.

I signed up, which took at best a 1-week after the application was sent in, and immediately earned the 10,000 bonus points.  Redeeming those points has been easy and less time consuming that you'd normally expect, so I'm satisfied in that regard.  I haven\u2019t had a chance to use the balance transfer, but 3% is pretty basic and useful for when I need it.

It wasn't the best banking experience I have ever had, though it definitely wasn't the worst either. I did appreciate the availability of the Chase ATMs and branches, and it seems like the bank has expanded in the past few years.  A new branch even recently opened up about a mile from my house! The last time I used the ATM (I am a Wells Fargo customer now), it printed out a direct deposit offer for $100 free for signing up, an offer of which I am interested in taking advantage. I have seen the commercials recently for their mobile banking application, which allows deposit of the checks via a smartphone. Neat! With my previous Chase enrollment, issues were normally resolved quickly enough and customer service representatives were friendly enough, so I am thinking about giving Chase another go. It seems as though I may be pleasantly surprised if I do so."},{"date":"2012-06-19","name":"Won Lee","user_id":"won.b.lee.7","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":2,"review":"Joe Weider  So, I got this card (sorry WalletHub, not through you guys) about a month ago, and I have been using it.   Now this deals more with United per se, rather than this card, but it ties together, so I want to talk about it. United miles are extremely valuable.  They allow one way award, and as long as you bok 3 weeks out (or if you have the club card $395 per yr),  then its just $25 per route. WOW!  You look at British airlines, and to use their miles to go to Europe, fee comes out to like $800-900 bux, so United is great!The downside of this card, is as Margie pointed out.  There are other cards available that competes with this card.... Say like Chase Sapphire Preferred.  I got this card for churning purposes.  If you look around web, u can find other deals where you get full 40k without spending $25k dollars.  not that you shouldn't, if you can, because you'd still get 25,000 miles from those 25k dollar spending,  but hey.  your mileage may vary. So get this card,  get 40k points, and then hold it for 11 months.  Dump it down the drain. Unless you fly United more than 5-8 times a year, all domestic, all economy,  this card really isn't that worth it."},{"date":"2012-06-19","name":"WalletHub","user_id":"WalletHub","verified":false,"product":null,"review_comment":true,"stars":0,"review":"Why not through us? :)  \n\nBTW, if you ever spot a link that has a better deal than what we have please let us know by emailing us at products at evolutionfinance.com or just leave a comment on the respective card.

But of course, I am here to present the other side to the story.  As always, consider your situation whenever you apply for a credit card, and make a decision based on the situation that suites you best.(Also, Margie made some statements that weren't necessarily true, so I wanted to correct that). So.  Let's play the devil's advocate.  When does this card makes sense to you? If you are a frequent United Flyer,  then this card might be a life saver. why? Let's start with lounge access.   Despite what Margie wrote down, suggesting that frequent flyer automatically gets lounge access, this isn't true with US legacy airlines for domestic travel.  Yes, if you buy an expensive international ticket, then lounge is included, but for domestic ones,  even if you fly \"first class\"  u don't get lounge.    You will have to buy lounge access( annual fee of $495), so if you fly domestic a lot on United, and u want the access to lounge service,  this card can be great.   What makes this card more beneficial is that Amex platinum no longer offers access to United\/Continental Lounge via Priority Pass.  So if you want a free access to United Lounge, this is the only way to get it. -  Furthermore,  you can have one companion go in with you, so its like getting 2 people's worth the money.Second:  Close Fee Award Waiver.   If you fly United a lot, you are most likely going to rack up some United Miles.  You want to use them of course, but unless you book 3 weeks out,  they will slap you with $75 charge. It would be great if we can plan out our trips in advance, but we can't time to time.  This card waives it. Third:  Priority Boarding. why is this important?  Although Margie can't believe people woud want to board sooner,  she can't be farther away from the truth (I know u don't fly much Margie, don't worry).  With bag fees these days, people are trying to cram as much as they can on carry-ons. This means that it's really a hassle to find a spot to put your backpack or small carry-ones, if you board late. There just isn't enough space for everyone's.  Those who board first, will have ample access to them, and this card gives that. Fourth:  Perks you don't think you need but are very useful because you  have them.  -  Hyatt Platinum  gives you late check-out, free internet,  and so forth.  You will use it, and u will go wow! -   Rental Car  Top Tier: Again,  little things makes big difference. -   Primary Collision waiver for rental cars:  If you are interested in renting a car oversea, this card can provide you free insurance (as long as u rent the car with this card).So considering all these, is it worth $395?   Make that choice yourself.  HOWEVER.... There is a way to reduce the cost of this card down to $195.   If you use amex plat's $200 airline pay-back program, then this card only costs $195.  Furthermore, there are codes floating around, that gives this card first yr free,  so do consider that as well."},{"date":"2012-06-18","name":"Sam","user_id":"xsam95","verified":false,"product":"Chase Student Loans","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I recently became a member of Chase bank by signing up for student loans.

The day after my birthday, I noticed I was overdrawn.

We had a loan modification process in the works with Chase. The process alone took approximately 9-10 months and resulted in a denial. This came because we did not update paperwork with Chase after receiving 3 notices from them that our paperwork was not complete and being told that it was a standard packet and all of our documentation was fine.

I cannot comment on the application process as when I started an account, it was with a bank called Washington Mutual. After several years banking there Chase purchased the company and quickly took over.The trouble all started when I started receiving unexpected checking fees. With my previous account there had been no monthly fees and Chase didn\u2019t bother to send any notice of changed policies. When I went into the bank to sort it out, I found an entirely new staff. While I\u2019m sure the changes were stressful, the staff members were completely unprofessional. They snapped out answers to my questions condescendingly and looked past me instead of addressing me directly. I was discouraged by this, but I chalked it up to a bad week. I later called them to check my balance and spent twenty minutes on hold.

In any event, I got it because the bonus it paid was a $5.00 Borders\/Walden Books coupon for every $500 I spent.  It might not seem like a great deal, but I'm a big fan of buying books (I'm a slow reader though so I have quite a back-log) so I enjoyed it.  I'd save up the certificates all year and use them on myself and to buy Christmas presents.  (My Walden Books honored the certificates even if they had expired.)  Eventually though Chase dropped the premium (even before those stores went out of business) and started a bonus points program.  I'd look through the gift premium catalog whenever it came in the mail, but never saw anything I wanted and eventually stopped paying attention to it.  It seemed like over the past year I started getting prompts from Chase to sign up for the bonus-bonus points each quarter.  (Really, if you want to give me a premium, that you claim I've \"earned\" for using your card, just give it to me.  What is with me having to sign-up for it?)  I ignored those as well.  Recently I bought a door from Home Depot and had to return it.  I kept checking the automated call system (that works relatively painlessly) to check transactions on my account.  When I didn't see it after several days I pressed zero to speak to an attendant.  After learning that the credit might not show up for seven to ten days (oddly, when I use the card, the transactions show up much more quickly than that), the attendant asked if I wanted to sign up for the quarterly bonus points.  I asked if it would cost me anything or cause me to be entered into a program that I didn't want to be in and she said that it would not.  So I said to sign me up.  She then asked if I tracked my bonus points.  I told her that I didn't pay attention to them.  She, (in a moment of non-scripted interaction), said \"good!  Would you like to know how many points you have?\"  I said, \"sure.\"  She replied that I had over 61,000 of them.  I told her that that sounded like a lot of points, but points were not money.  She said, \"Want to know how many dollars those points are worth?\"  Again, I said \"Sure.\"  To make a long story less long, it turned out that because I had been ignoring my bonus points for several years I had accumulated over $600 in points and she would send me a check for that amount.  So, while I might believe that credit card corporations are basically soulless, evil creatures (although people nonetheless) at least on that day I didn't dislike them so much."},{"date":"2012-06-14","name":"Zoe Charpia","user_id":"zoec_2","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I have used this credit card for over 10 years and have been very pleased with it.

My student loan process with JP Chase was relatively easy and a simple process. I had a personal representative that helped me through the loan process and any balance that was left over after my school expenses were paid, went straight to my account as a positive balance. The left over money comes in handy for a college student. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always had pretty decent customer service at my local branch when it comes to making deposits, withdrawing money and other questions or services that I may have or needed at the current time. One of thing that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always found helpful is the up to date tips that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve received from the bank tellers. For example I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had problems with overdraft fees in the past with Chase that has gotten me into trouble a couple of times but a bank teller told me about overdraft protection, which I was not aware of at the time. The overdraft protection was nice because it allowed money from my savings to transfer to my checking if a negative transaction ever went through to keep my balance positive. I also got overdraft protection from fees and stuff which I actually qualified through my parents because my credit at the time was not strong enough, since I was just a student. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had the same account with Chase for almost six years which is still in good standing. A couple of the bank tellers know me by a first name basis which makes me feel like a valued customer. Chase is also convenient as a bank because it is so popular. I do a lot of traveling and having a Chase at almost every corner is a plus because I never have to worry about extra ATM fees or having to deal with the hassles of \u00e2\u0080\u009caway\u00e2\u0080\u009d banking if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m out of town and need to do an emergency transaction.

You can do everything online or go into a local branch to get your account set up. The minimum deposit to open an account is twenty-five dollars. If you do have bad credit, Chase does offer something like preferred checking which you have to pay fifteen dollars a month.

The people who work there are always really nice but my biggest problem with Chase is that even though the people are really nice, they are very aggressive when it comes to their sales tactics. This is not just one location, I have entered different Chase branches on multiple occasions to be approached by someone who is going to \"help my make my deposit\" and then it turns into a sales tactic to get me to sign up for some special checking. One time, I left there and had apparently signed up for a checking that would get me bonus points but cost me $25 per year!

In that time I have come to realize that Chase is the best bank there is. Their customer service is very friendly, down to earth, and almost always immediate. If I submit a question to their tech support team, or customer service team- I get an answer within a few hours. The perks of the checking account are great, because when you open an account, not only do you get an opening bonus (amounts vary from $100 to $250) , you get your first order of checks free.Overall, Chase is a great option for any bank- and as long as you have direct deposit, you won\u2019t have any monthly fees. I highly recommend Chase to anyone who needs a quality bank and doesn\u2019t want to have to deal with the nonsense of being a cog in a wheel of another bank.Their website is easy to access, navigate, and manage. You are able to pay bills online, do bill transfers, and even order checks and overnight checks.

I disputed the charge online and they removed it temporarily while investigation was ongoing. A month later, I received a letter in the mail that they have \"deemed the charge to be valid\" and that it will be re-applied to my account.(I mean, anyone with half a brain can see that all my account activities during the time were made in France, except for that one fraudulent charge, and the name on the ticket is obvious not someone related to me!)So I called their fraud department to sort out the situation. The person taking my case was actually quite helpful. He issued me a new card and posted an adjustment for the charge. Since I got the card I've been racking up $7000 - $8000 on average per month, so normally I don't check my account in too much detail (it's really a lot of work) as long as the balance looks about right. But because of this fraud problem I almost didn't use my card at all during this past month (took a while for me to get the replacement card), and I was surprised to see a balance of about $2600. For some reason the numbers just don't look right. So I did my own calculation in spreadsheet and summed up all the transactions to-date. The balance actually ends up to be about $1300. I e-mailed them about the discrepency. They didn't even bother to check the numbers, just insisted that I pay the balance as shown in their system.I mean, I know credit card companies are always trying to squeeze money from the card holders, but they wouldn't go so far as cooking the books, would they?"},{"date":"2012-07-04","name":"Won Lee","user_id":"won.b.lee.7","verified":false,"product":null,"review_comment":true,"stars":0,"review":"Amily, they wouldn't cook up books. Largely because as you mentioned, if someone like you put out lawsuits, the damage from that action is far greater than cheating someone of 1-2k dollars. \n\nWhat often happens in fraud cases, is they will withhold ALL charges. This includes legitimate ones as well as fraudulent ones. As such, when the bill is posted, you have paid a lot less money than what you should have (since legit ones are also withheld, and doesn't reflex the actual spending). \n\nOnce investigation is complete, they will remove fraudulent ones, and which they did, did they not? Chase is great at responding to your needs in this regard, and not many banks make it this easy.  But after they got rid of fraudulent ones, they will post the legit ones, to which you have to pay for. \n\nThis is what i suggest you go through one more time to verify actual spending and payment. \n\nYou obviously summed up all spends,  now go to your bank's website and see how much money you have paid in total.  If that discrepancy still exists, then you should show that to Chase, and they will respond to that.

There is almost never any problems with the site, it is easy to understand and gives detailed descriptions of everything on the site. I have never had to worry about a random charge that I didn\u2019t understand through Chase. It always tells me in plain English what it is, and where it is coming from.Customer service representatives at the banks are always super nice and helpful.The online bill pay is amazing as well. You can set up all of your bills in your payments account and once a month, send out however much money you want to which bill and Voila!A lot of the times, when you sign up for Chase there is promotional deals where if you put $100 in your account, they\u2019ll give you $100. Who doesn\u2019t love that?Cons: There is a service fee per month to use my checking account. It\u2019s not outrageously high, only $12.99\/month unless I have direct deposits of over $500 a month.There aren\u2019t a lot of locations in my area. This might be different for some, but when I need to actually go to the bank, it is a good 40-45 minute drive.In Summary:I have been really pleased with Chase Bank. The online bill pay has saved me tons of time and given me more ease of mind. Chase has it set up where I almost never even have to go to the bank for anything anymore.

I suppose this is how I ended up with three different Chase Bank credit cards without even realizing it - one for Shell Gas, one for Amazon, and one for Continental (now United) Airlines. So clearly the application process gets five stars - it's so easy I barely even notice myself doing it! But the customer service has been just so-so - they outsource much of it overseas, which can get frustrating, and often they aren't able to help with good offers when I need to do a balance transfer. Overall, I much prefer my Citibank Visa even though I don't get some of the special perks like points or airline miles. I also am not a huge fan of some of the, shall we say, less than smart business decisions Chase has recently been outed for in the news. Because of this, I don't really trust Chase Bank the way I do my bank (Wells Fargo) or Citibank. But this is just one person's experience, and obviously I am not unhappy enough to close my accounts with Chase.

The transition to Chase was seamless, I didn't have to do anything. However, once my account was set up and running, I began to have problems. Although the people working at my branch were the same, suddenly they had much less leeway in how they handled my problems. Fees and charges started coming from nowhere, hidden behind a vague 'it's policy'.On the plus side, the online banking was quick and easy, the tellers at my local branch were always friendly. The day to day operations were top notch, as long as I didn't have a problem. However, once a problem cropped up it was tough to actually get through it without waiting on hold for an hour or more, and going outside the local branch for help. I was finally forced to switch banks, and to be honest I don't really miss anything about Chase except the friendly people helping me in my local branch."},{"date":"2012-05-30","name":"Pete Rock","user_id":"PFranklin","verified":false,"product":"Chase Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"Lots of people are against big banks these days, but in over two years with Chase, I've never had a single problem. I have my primary checking account and two credit cards with them.To start with, I signed up because of a promotion awarding $200 for new checking customers. The sign up was smooth, and the teller that helped me through was great. About six months later, I was offered a credit card promotion called \"Pay and Get,\" or something. If, for a six month period,I refrained from using my main CC, and paid at least $150 towards it every month, I would be rewarded with a $150 credit. I did so and received my credit promptly. I thought it was a great promotion to help motivate people to lessen debt. But the point of these stories is that by using Chase, in a period of about a year I reaped $350 in cash rewards for doing very little.On top of that, I use a Chase Freedom Card, which pays 1% back on all purchases, and 5% on various categories that change quarterly. I've made about $50 back just on groceries in the last two months.As a bank, I have had no issues with Chase whatsoever. There are plenty of locations, so I never have a problem finding an ATM. The ATMs are super quick, much faster than my previous bank. I have yet to use their check-depositing smartphone App, but the ability to deposit a check via your phone's camera is pretty cool. One thing I do take advantage of is their online bill-paying system. It's super easy to pay my student loans and phone bill right from my checking account, without having to risk inputting my bank info into third-party websites.The Chase website is very well-integrated, linking all your accounts together and displayed on one main screen.I would recommend Chase to someone looking to open a checking account, and especially if you already use one of their credit cards.

I\u2019ve been with them since October of 2010, so about 1 year and 7 months. In this time I\u2019ve had to deal with a few issues regarding my checking account, including fraudulent charges made from the United Kingdom, that wiped out my entire account right before rent and bills were due. I was, of course, frantic about what I would do because I never pay my bills late, and I didn\u2019t want to have to do that because of something I couldn\u2019t control. I called Chase, and right away they helped me request a new card, and deactivate the old one, as well as refer me to another department which gave me enough of a balance while my claim was to be filed so that I could pay my bills. That was really great of them! It only took 2 more days to get my claim through, and get my money back, since they had to wait for the fraudulent charge to clear first. Overall, I haven\u2019t had anything but this happen, and I love that I can, on days that I\u2019m going to get paid, charge things on my account if I really need to and pay them before the end of the day, and not get charged overdraft fees.

I have had zero problems that with them that would have required me to visit in person, or even have any need to email\/call them from home. They have one of the best banking system in which I can control most of my finances online quite easily and hassle free.The application process was quite easy, streamlined and timely. They even gave me a $200 coupon bonus for opening an account with them. I have two other bank accounts, and with each one I had to call them at least twice each to get my account opened, but with Chase Bank I had none of these problems. I went, submitted the application, went home and the account was opened in the minimum time they told me it would take.The representative was very polite, knowledgeable and helpful. He explained all charges that may or may not be levied on my account based on different services I would use, minimum balance etc. He even printed out a detailed summary of all charges that could be applicable to me. I am happy to say that I am aware of all the charged they levy, and have not had to face any \"hidden\" charges other banks usually charge and do not inform you of. I do a lot of selling and buying online which involves sending and receiving payments from a number of different sources like Paypal and Skrill etc. My Chase account allows me do both, at either zero cost, or a minimum one which is bonus point. I can easily wire money to anyone I need.Their have a variety of credit cards with both cash back and points focuses. I chose cash back since they have a wide range of stores and offers which I can avail to minimize my costs, and earn cash as well.On the whole I would rate Chase Bank at 10\/10.

It\u2019s got a sleek look and a catchy name that reminds people of water (which is calming) and cash (which we all obviously love), but you shouldn\u2019t open any card for its branding.  You want it to save or make you the most money possible; that will make you far happier than having a pretty card that hurts your wallet.  Anyway, let\u2019s see if Chase\u2019s first prepaid card is more than just a pretty face.The first thing that strikes me about the Chase Liquid Card (besides its look of course) is the small number of fees that it charges.  Besides the $4.95 monthly fee, you won\u2019t really get charged for much.  Chase ATM withdrawals are free, customer service is free, there\u2019s no inactivity fee or anything.  From what I\u2019ve seen prepaid cards are best used as fill-ins for checking accounts or to teach kids how to handle money.  I wouldn\u2019t use the Liquid Card as a checking account because the Orchard Bank Prepaid Card is free if you load something like $1,000 a month.  The Liquid Card doesn\u2019t allow you to escape the monthly fee, and it doesn\u2019t have a bill pay option as far as I\u2019ve seen.  Using it for teaching your child isn\u2019t a bad idea though because kids aren\u2019t going to deposit that much anyway.Bottom line, the Chase Liquid Prepaid Card is an interesting offer because it\u2019s likely to be one of the first big bank prepaid cards introduced in the coming months, and it\u2019s interesting to see whether the offers the big boys come up with can compete with the top dogs already in the prepaid card market.  Also it will be interesting to see whether Chase adds a way to escape the Liquid Card\u2019s fees to let it compete more with the Orchard Card."},{"date":"2012-05-08","name":"Margie Cole","user_id":"margie.cole.52","verified":false,"product":"Chase Prepaid Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"Lookie here, a Chase prepaid card.  Looks like everyone (including WalletHub, if I remember correctly) who predicted more prepaid cards hitting the market after the Federal Reserve fussed with debit card fees were right.  Nice work! Anyway, I\u2019m not going to even try to understand the minute details that went into this cause and effect.  But I always like taking a critical eye to a new card offer, and the Liquid Card from Chase definitely isn\u2019t going to escape the Margie Treatment! Boom, pro\/con time:Pros-\tNumber of Fees:  Looking at other prepaid cards, all you see is fee after fee after fee, and if you\u2019ve ever tried to pick a prepaid card to open, you know this makes it so annoying to predict a card\u2019s cost and judge whether it will be more or less expensive than another one.  I don\u2019t mean to say that the Chase Liquid Card is perfect, it\u2019s got fees, but it doesn\u2019t have as many as say the Approved Card from Suze Orman.-\tOverall cost:  The Chase Liquid Prepaid Card can be as cheap as $4.95\/mo. which puts it in the upper echelon of prepaid cards, and potentially even less expensive than the GreenDot Visa for some people.-\tFree live customer service might not seem like a pro since it should be standard but a lot of prepaid cards charge for it.-\tName:  I\u2019m sure a lot of people will be more comfortable using a prepaid card from a name bank like Chase instead of one called BabyPhat, Mango, etc.Cons-\tOverall cost:  This is both a pro and a con since the GreenDot Card can be free for some of ya\u2019ll.-\tThe GreenDot Card gives you a chance to avoid a monthly fee by loading a certain amout, but the Liquid Card doesn\u2019t, which seems like a shame to me.  There\u2019s a cap to how good this offer can be.-\tPotential for high ATM fees:  If you don\u2019t live near a Chase ATM, you\u2019ll have to choose between what\u2019s most convenience and what\u2019s cheapest, and when things get buys most of us choose convenience.When you got down to it, the prepaid card market just got a bit better today with Chase\u2019s introduction of its new prepaid card, the Liquid Card.  Its one of the better offers available, in my opinion, and I recommend it if you don\u2019t live near a GreenDot ATM or don\u2019t want to keep that much money in your new-era checking account, i.e. your prepaid card account."},{"date":"2012-10-14","name":"Anthony Bey","user_id":"aly.masakela","verified":false,"product":null,"review_comment":true,"stars":0,"review":"American Express prepaid card is better.

The reason is simple, it doesn\u2019t offer enough value for someone who isn\u2019t routinely staying at a Hyatt hotel and earning the 3 points per dollar that the Hyatt Card provides on Hyatt purchases.   This is especially true in light of the Hyatt Credit Card\u2019s competition, which will become clear after this quick pro\/con list.Pros-\t2 Free nights:  You get 2 free Hyatt nights after your first purchase, and free hotel accommodations are always nice, especially with summer coming up.-\tWith a Hyatt Credit Card account, you get one free night each year on your cardholder anniversary.Cons-\t2 Free Nights:  The Hyatt Card\u2019s initial bonus is both a pro and a con given that it\u2019s attractive in a vacuum but unattractive when considered along with the competition.  The Hilton Credit Card gives you up to 8 free nights and the Chase Sapphire Preferred offers $500 for travel or $400 in cash.-\tAnnual fee:  The Hyatt Credit Card charges a $75 annual fee, which pretty much counteracts the  free anniversary night.-\tOngoing rewards:  One point per dollar for non-Hyatt purchases isn\u2019t great, and neither is the 3 points for Hyatt purchases, unless you\u2019re constantly racking them up.-\tNo low interest rates:  Despite its lacking rewards, the Hyatt Credit Card is a rewards credit card through and through, seeing as it doesn\u2019t offer 0% intro rates on purchases or transfers.Long story short, I wouldn\u2019t get the Hyatt Card.  Instead, if an initial bonus is what I\u2019m after, I\u2019d go with the Chase Sapphire Preferred or the Hilton Card.

Chase has obviously upped the ante with its revamped Ink Cash offer since it now offers 0% for 12 months.  Since business credit cards don\u2019t have the same protection against random interest rate increases as personal credit cards, having a year of an assured 0% rate would be helpful for a small business owner looking to use a single credit card for business spending and funding.  It also lets people who want to do a balance transfer make purchases with their card without wasting a bunch of dough on interest that comes from not having a grace period (when you revolve a balance you don\u2019t have one!).If I were in the market for small business cards, I still think I\u2019d go with the Ink Bold with Ultimate Rewards and either the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card or one of the Citicards offering 0% for 18 months, depending on if I wanted to transfer a balance or just avoid interest on new purchases, instead of the Ink Cash.  The Ink Bold just offers better rewards and the others are personal cards with way longer 0% rates than the Ink Cash.

It's called,   Chase Tri-Fecta trick.   First you need 3 things: 1) Chase Freedom.2) Chase Sapphire preferred (or chase Ink Bold for Business).3) Chase Checking account. I will explain how first one work in this scheme, but let's start with other two.  Byhaving Chase sapphire Preferred  or Ink Bold,  u can transfer ultimate reward points (chase's bonus point system) into miles and hotel points. Since miles are most lucrative, let's stick with that.  and why is that important here? Because points you earn from Chase Freedom is really, ultimate reward points as well. With Freedom alone,  you can't transfer it to miles, but u can transfer ultimate reward points u earn from Freedom (200 cash back really means u get 20,000 ultimate reward points) to your Saph. Pref. or Ink Bold, and convert it to miles. So in essense, u are really getting $400 worth of free stuff, for a card that COSTS YOU ZERO EVERY YEAR. now, chase checking account. If you can open a chase checking account AND have chase freedom,  every single purchase, u get 10 reward points.  So those trips to vending machines? I put it on my chase freedom. then I get 11 (10 bonus +1 from purchase) for every king sized kit-kat bar I enjoy. on top of other things Joe and Margie mention, this is what makes this trifecta awesome.  you are literally getting cash back 6-11% (if u don't fly), or up to 22 % return by using the method above. get it?  so go get this card, and keep it forever (as long as T&C don't change)."},{"date":"2012-04-20","name":"Won Lee","user_id":"won.b.lee.7","verified":false,"product":null,"review_comment":true,"stars":0,"review":" Joe Weider although i will never claim i understand general public when it comes to miles earning scheme (in my mind, why would they not?) you are absolutely right that this takes effort, which people might not give a darn about.

It sure seems like big initial bonus season or something  because Alec Baldwin has been firing up potential Capital One customers recently with the Venture Card\u2019s Double Miles Challenge and Chase and British Airways just brought back the British Airways Credit Card\u2019s 100,000 bonus mile deal.  In other words, you get 50,000 bonus miles for getting the British Airways rewards Card and making a single purchase, 25,000 additional bonus miles for spending $10,000 within the first year, and another 25,000 for spending another $10,000.  Sorry to get your hopes up because 100,000 bonus miles sounds a lot better than 50,000 plus the possibility of 25,000 more and the unlikely chance to get another 25,000.  Anyway, I think going over some of the pros and cons of the British Airways Credit Card.Pros -\tYou\u2019re assured of at least 50,000 Avios points with the British Airways Credit Card and since you only need 12,500 to get a free economy cross country flight and 20,000 for a transatlantic one, that\u2019s a pretty good deal in and of itself.-\tIf you spend enough to get the additional 50,000 bonus miles from the BA Credit Card, you\u2019ll probably also be able get a free companion ticket each year\u2026not too shabby.-\tThe British Airways Credit Card is obviously geared toward international travel, so while having no foreign transaction fees is expected, it\u2019s nice to see nonetheless.Cons-\tThe ongoing rewards (2.5 Avios miles per $1 spent on BA and 1.25 on everything else) aren\u2019t really anything of note, although if you do fly BA a lot, they will come in handy.-\tThe fact that the Chase British Airways Card is a \u201csmartcard\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean much.  The caqrd doesn\u2019t have a PIN, which means you wont be able to use it at train kiosks and stuff like that out of the country.-\tMy friend once got the BA Card and said that redeeming rewards miles is made very difficult by things like blackout dates and restrictions.-\tA $95 annual fee isn\u2019t what you like to see, but this card\u2019s rewards have the potential to be worth it.All in all whether or not you get the British Airways Credit Card really depends on how much you travel and how often you do so with British Airways.  If you do both a lot, the BA Card should be in your wallet and you can be very happy about all the bonus miles.  If you want to use this card for a single European adventure or something like that, it could work, but you need to be flexible about when you travel.  I would not get this card if you never travel internationally and just want to maybe do so down the road because cash would be worth a lot more to u and the miles you get might go unredeemed."},{"date":"2012-04-02","name":"Margie Cole","user_id":"margie.cole.52","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"People looooveee getting free stuff from their credit cards, so much so that its easy to forget that this free stuff inevitably has a dollar value, which it\u2019s important to find out and compare to the cash offers available from other cards.  I mean you could be wowed by the 6 free nights you can get by opening the Marriott Credit Card, but I personally have no idea what a category 1 hotel is and whether its on the good or bad end of the spectrum.  This is important because you should really only get a hotel or airline affiliated card, such as the Marriott Card, for ongoing use if you use that company\u2019s services frequently and consistently.  The pool of people who could benefit from a good initial bonus would be much larger, however.  So read my likes and dislikes about the Marriott Rewards Credit Card with a sense of what group you\u2019d fit into.Pros-\tDepending on where you stay and when, the Marriot Card\u2019s initial bonus should be worth somewhere in the $400 \u2013 900 range, which is pretty great.-\tThe Marriott Credit Card gives you Marriott status points; you start off with Silver status and get 10 points toward Elite status; your status dictates the number of free goodies and services you get each time you stay.Cons-\tThree points per $1 spent at Marriott Hotels isn\u2019t that great as far as ongoing rewards are concerned.-\tWhile there\u2019s no annual fee in the first year, having to pay $45 a year thereafter for average ongoing rewards isn\u2019t that great.So, for those of you considering applying for the Marriott Rewards Credit Card, here\u2019s what I\u2019d do.  If you stay at Marriott properties all the time, I\u2019d pass on the Marriott Rewards Card for its Premier counterpart, the Marriott Rewards Premier Credit Card.  It has a better initial bonus and better ongoing rewards, so for the frequent Marriott customer, it\u2019d be worth the $85 annual fee (beginning in the second year).  And since non-frequent customers would presumably only be getting the Marriott Credit Card for the initial bonus, I\u2019d recommend that they get the Premier option too.  The thinking here is that you can get 7 or 8 free nights as opposed to 6 and probably wouldn\u2019t keep your account open for longer than a year anyway.  Even if you want to, the free night you get each year would pretty much pay for the annual fee.

The United MileagePlus Explorer Credit Card requires excellent credit for approval, doesn\u2019t have an annual fee in the first year (but charges $95\/yr. after that), and offers an interesting initial bonus as well as some decent ongoing rewards and some assorted other perks.  I find it easiest to decide on whether a card is good or not by making a pro\/con list, so here\u2019s mine for the United Plus Explorer Card:Pros-\t 25,000 bonus miles after first purchase (enough for a one-way ticket to Hawaii and nearly enough for one to Europe).-\tUnited\u2019s deep roster of rewards partners allows you to immediately transfer miles at full value to other travel companies\u2019 rewards programs (e.g. British Airways, Amtrak, Hyatt Hotels).-\tAssorted perks like Club passes, priority boarding, and free checked baggage not only make travel more comfortable, but less expensive as well.Cons-\tYou can\u2019t get the extra 15,000 bonus points advertised if you don\u2019t add an authorized user or spend a crazy amount each year.-\tThe miles per dollar spent are not competitive with the best travel rewards cards on the market.United has one of the most interesting travel rewards programs around, thanks to its many rewards partners and the deals it has struck with issuers like Chase that allow you to transfer, say, Chase rewards into United Miles and redeem them with any United travel partner.  In light of this latter consideration, you can benefit from United\u2019s wide-ranging rewards program even if you don\u2019t get a United credit card like the MileagePlus Explorer Card.  For example, you could get the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, which has an initial bonus worth $625 in travel, transfer this bonus to a United partner\u2019s rewards program and benefit just the same.  You could likewise get any Southwest Airlines credit card, for example, and do the same.  With that being said, I\u2019d compare all of the credit cards affiliated with United rewards and pick the most lucrative offer.  You could also get a card like the Capital one Venture Card, which offers miles that equate to 2% cash back on all purchases if you redeem them toward any travel-related expenses.  Also, if you don\u2019t travel a lot, I\u2019d go with a good cash back card like the Blue Cash preferred from Amex bc it will provide more consistent benefits.

To do that lets make a good old fashioned pro\/con list.Pro-The Chase Freedom Visa obviously gives you a $100 initial bonus as well as a 0% intro APR (6 months on purchases and 12 months on transfers).- 5% cash back on rotating spending categories.-1% cash back on everything else.Cons-The $100 initial bonus is far less than what you could get from the Chase Sapphire Preferred ($500-625).- The 0% offer is not as good as three different CitiCards that offer 0% on both purchases and transfers for 18 moths or the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate, which offers 0% on both for 15 months and does not charge a transfer fee.-To get the 5% on rotating expenses, you have to sign up each quarter.Overall, the Chase Freedom Credit Card with the $100 initial bonus and 0% intro APR is pretty good, but not good enough.  This seems fairly representative of the credit card market these days; a lot of good offers, only a few great ones.  You already know whoch cards I\u2019d recommend for low rates and initial bonuses, but if you want better rewards than what the Chase Freedom Visa Card offers, I\u2019d go with the Blue Cash Preferred from Amex or the Capital One Venture Card."},{"date":"2012-03-15","name":"Margie Cole","user_id":"margie.cole.52","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":2,"review":"I know that $200 sounds really good.

Wow, that may have come off as conceited, but trust me, anyone can figure out credit cards if they follow industry news; it\u2019s just a hobby of mine, which some would probably call strange. Anyway, I don\u2019t comment a lot, but I can\u2019t resist telling people about a great deal, and that\u2019s exactly what the No Balance Transfer Slate Card from Chase is. This card offers a 0% introductory APR on purchases as well as balance transfers for 15 months and true to its name, does not charge a balance transfer fee. If you were going to transfer $20,000 in credit card to the No Balance Transfer Slate Card, for instance, its lack of a balance transfer fee would save you $600 relative to a card charging the standard 3% fee. That\u2019s not even the most interesting thing about the Slate Card with No Balance Transfer Fee. After this offer initially caught my eye, I read up on it a bit. Apparently, no transfer fee 0% cards were common a couple years ago but that 2010 personal finance law made the shady practices serving as their revenue source illegal. Nothing\u2019s changed though, so I don\u2019t really know how Chase can offer this card (and a lot of people smarter than me feel the same way). But it doesn\u2019t really matter when you get down to it, now does it?

Every time I look around there are new deals where you get thousands of points\/miles or hundreds of dollars cash back for opening a new card and making a single purchase or spending a certain amount in the first few months. (Apparently, a bank cannot just give you the points\/miles\/cash back because it would then be taxable; thanks Citi!). At any rate, one of the best initial bonuses out there right now comes from the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. When you open this card and spend at least $3,000 in the first three months, you get 50,000 bonus miles, which are worth either a $500 check\/statement credit or $625 in hotels and airfare. $625, wow! Who knew such a little piece of plastic could pack such a big punch? The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card isn\u2019t only about the initial bonus, but you should really pretend that is the case. The reason why is the Sapphire Preferred Card does not offer attractive ongoing rates or rewards. You only get 1-2 points per dollar you charge, depending on the type of purchase, as well as a 7% annual rewards dividend. This is not competitive compared to rewards credit cards like the Capital One Venture or the Blue Cash Everyday from Amex.

In doing so keep in mind that such cards only allow you to save on gas purchased at those specific stations, so if you\u2019re not a brand loyal gas pumper, you won\u2019t get as much value as you\u2019d like from such a card.  Nevertheless, let\u2019s see what the Hess Credit Card has to offer, as it\u2019s likely to be a main consideration for a lot of consumers.  The Hess Rewards Credit Card gives you different gas savings depending on the time since you opened your account.  You see, during the first 60 days your account is open, the Hess Card will give you 10% off each net $1 you spend at Hess locations (up to $400 spent).  In other words, you can take up to $40 off your two-month Hess tab by using the Hess Credit card.  After that, you get 3% off Hess purchases.  The Hess Rewards Card also gives you 1% off purchases made everywhere else (except other gas stations, of course).  Overall, while this offer might sound good, you\u2019d basically be sacrificing a better long-term rebate for up to $40 in the short term.  Since using the Hess Credit Card also pretty much requires that you only get gas at Hess stations, you also sacrifice logistical flexibility.If you\u2019re a loyal Hess customer, opting for a credit card tied to a different gas station rather than the Hess Credit Card won\u2019t help you because you\u2019d also have to shift your consumption habits, not possible for most people.  Going with a generic gas rewards card instead of the Hess Rewards Card would be helpful though as such cards offer gas rewards no matter what station you fill up at.  The Pentagon Federal Credit Union Cash Rewards Card for example gives you 5% cash back on gas purchases paid at the pump as well as 1% on everything else.  While the Blue Cash Everyday card from Amex only gives you 2% on gas, it also gives you 3% at supermarkets, 2% at department stores, and 1% on everything else.

Let\u2019s find out.  First of all, the Disney Premier Card requires good or excellent credit for approval and charges a $49 annual fee. That simply clues you into the fact that it better have some good rewards or long 0% intro terms because those things are available from cards with the same credit requirements and comparable, if not cheaper, annual fees.  Starting with rewards, the Disney Premier Credit Card offers a $100 statement credit after first use, 2% in Disney Dollars back on purchases made at gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants and Disney stores and locations; 1% back everywhere else.  It also offers 0% on purchases for six months.  The Disney Premier Card is therefore decent overall.  You don\u2019t find many co-branded credit cards offering rewards on big expense categories like gas, groceries and dining, but the fact that each Disney dollar is worth an actual dollar only when redeeming for Disney goods and travel, the usefulness of these rewards is kind of limited.Some alternatives to the Premier Disney Credit Card are in order then.  The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card is a good option in the sense that it offers an initial bonus worth $625 in travel or $100 in cash.

If you, like him, are an ardent supporter of Cornell University or Big Red athletics, then you might consider getting the Cornell Card as well.  It\u2019s never a good idea to open a financial product based on branding alone though (much less a sitcom character\u2019s affinity), so we need to see what it offers before you hit that apply button.  With the Cornell Credit Card, you get 1 point for every $1 you spend, which you can redeem for a number of things, including cash gift certificates, travel, etc.  That\u2019s it.  Oh, and you can only compile a maximum of 60,000 points each year.  There aren\u2019t any 0% introductory rates either.  If you\u2019ve read any of my other little credit card reviews, you know that this just isn\u2019t going to cut it.  The best rewards programs a) don\u2019t have rewards earning caps b) give you 1% cash back or 1 point per $1 spent as a base c) have much higher earning rates for certain spending categories.  The Cornell University Credit Card is therefore certainly not worth your hard earned good or excellent credit (though Cornell may have helped give you the smarts needed to get it), especially considering how much this credit standing can be worth via other cards.For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card offers a $500-625 initial bonus; the Capital One Venture Card gives you 2% cash back across all purchases as long as you redeem miles for  travel related purchases; the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express gives you 3% cash back at supermarkets, 2% cash back at gas stations and department stores and 1% on everything else.  Each of these cards boasts better rewards than the Cornell University Card.  Oh, and lastly, the cool thing about Capital One credit cards is that you can personalize the entire front of em with pictures of your choice.

These features are designed to catch your eye, and they certainly do accomplish that task, but what you have to figure out is whether the Slate Card \u2013 No Balance Transfer Fee is truly outstanding or just standing out.  The first thing ya gotta understand is that a balance transfer fee is just one of the costs to watch out for when transferring a balance (moving your debt from one credit card to another to get a lower interest rate).  The other primary cost obviously stems from the balance transfer interest rate you get and (since most cards these days are offering 0% introductory rates) how long it\u2019s offered for.  You need to weigh all of these factors in evaluating any balance transfer card, including the Chase Slate no balance transfer fee offer.  The best way to compare balance transfer cards is to figure out how much you can afford to put toward your credit card debt each month and use a balance transfer calculator to figure out how long it will take you to pay it off.  That will make it easy to figure out how much of a balance would remain following the end of any card\u2019s 0% intro rate.  Comparing the effects of interest incurred at this time to the money you\u2019d theoretically save by having no balance transfer fee will tell you whether eschewing a longer 0% period for a card with no transfer fee would be a good idea.  The point is that you should not allow a credit card company\u2019s marketing to influence your choice too much.  Credit card companies love to zero out a card\u2019s terms in one area and typically offset this in other areas.  In other words, the Slate no balance transfer fee credit card might not actually be a better offer than certain cards that do have a balance transfer fee.I can\u2019t tell you for certain which the best card is as so much depends on your individual situation, but some cards to check out are the Discover More Card and the three Citicards offering 0% for 18 months.  It\u2019s also important to note that if a card advertises its 0% rate as a range (0% for 6-12 months), you shouldn\u2019t assume or hope that you\u2019ll get the high end.  How long you\u2019ll get it for depends on your credit score.

To answer this initial query, though, I had to take a closer look at the details of what it offers.  First of all, the Slate from Chase requires good or excellent credit for approval and does not have an annual fee.  That initially tells you that the Slate Card probably doesn\u2019t have the best possible rates or rewards (those usually come with a fee) but that it better have some attractive terms to warrant someone with exemplary credit standing submitting an application.  Well, Chase\u2019s Slate Card does not have rewards, so it all comes dwon to its rates.  It offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 15 months.  Unfortunately, this does not stack up with the competition.The Citi Simplicity, Diamond Preferred, and Platinum Select Cards all offer 0% on purchases and transfers for 21 months and, like the Slate Credit Card from Chase, do not have annual fees.  The Discover More Card, like the Slate Card, also offers 0% for 15 months, but it gives you rewards too.

That means the Marriott Card isn\u2019t only useful for brand loyal frequent travelers as is often the case with hotel or airline credit cards affiliated with specific companies.  In other words, even if you don\u2019t stay at a Marriott Hotel on a regular basis, you could still make use of the six free nights the Marriott Credit Card gives you.  That\u2019s not to say that loyal Marriott customers won\u2019t benefit either because they certainly will.

Immediate appeal is not going to dictate the card you get though, so lets see exactly what the Ink Cash Business Credit Card has to offer.  To start the Ink Cash offers $250 cash back for spending $5,000 in the first three months. Moving forward you get 5% cash back on the first $25,000 spent on on office supplies as well as cable and phone services.

It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s a charge card because when it comes to interest rates, you want to be talking about personal credit cards anyway.  They do not increase your personal liability but they do prevent issuers from changing your interest rates without cause since they are protected by the CARD Act.  There are also a couple Citicards offers 0% for 21 months, so I\u2019d start there when looking for a card to handle funding.

This Ink Classic Business Credit Card from Chase offers up to 25,000 bonus points \u2013 15,000 after your first purchase and 10k after you spend $5,000 in the first three months.

The Ink Classic is therefore a competitive rewards business credit card that you can use for both funding and everyday expenses for the first six months.  You should not carry a balance on a Chase business credit card otherwise though because business credit cards do not have CARD Act protection, which means your issuer can change your interest rate at any time for any reason.  If you open the Ink Classic for Business Credit Card, I\u2019d also get one of Citi\u2019s 0% personal credit cards to use for funding purposes since Citi has three different cards offering 0% on purchases and transfers for 21 months and personal credit cards do not increase a small business owner\u2019s personal liability, interestingly enough.  This advice would hold true with pretty much any business credit card you get for everyday spending, and I would recommend looking around a bit before ultimately deciding on the Ink Classic.  The Capital One Spark Cash for Business is a good option as well since it offers 2% cash back across all purchases.  In addition, the Chase Ink Bold has a very attractive initial bonus (twice as large as the Ink Classic\u2019s), and even though it\u2019s a charge card, it\u2019s a good choice since you should be paying for in full for your everyday expenses anyway."},{"date":"2012-01-10","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"The Ink Bold with Ultimate Rewards from Chase is the business credit card currently offering the most lucrative initial bonus.

All this means is that you won\u2019t be given a line of credit and you will have to pay your balance in full every month, which should not actually be a deal breaker.  The reason for this is that you should ideally have one credit card for everyday expenses and another for funding.  There are a number of reasons why this is a good idea.  1) You can get both the best rewards and the longest 0% into term with two different cards 2) If you revolve a balance on a credit card, you don\u2019t have a grace period and new purchases will incur interest immediately 3) most business credit cards do not give you debt stability because the CARD Act does not apply to small business credit cards.

The $100 initial bonus the Chase Freedom Visa offers is good, but not great when you consider that cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred offer either at least $500.  Yeah, you will probably have to spend more in the first three months to get it, but if you will spend that much anyway, that\u2019s not a concern.  The Chase Freedom Visa\u2019s 0% APR offers are decent as well, but you can get 0% on both transfers and purchases for 21 months with the Citi Simplicity and Platinum Select credit cards.  When it comes to rewards, you can do better than 5% on rotating categories and 1% on everything else, particularly since you have to sign up for those rotating categories and not everyone will remember to do so every quarter.  On their own, each of the Chase Freedom Visa - $100 cash back + 0% Intro APR card\u2019s features is inferior to available options.  So what about the sum of these parts?  Getting a single card that addresses all of your needs (e.g. rewards, lowering the cost of debt, etc.) isn\u2019t the best idea, precisely because you are unlikely to get any features that excel in their own right.  For most people, I\u2019d recommend segmenting your needs and getting the best possible card to meet each of them.  If you want to use a 0% intro purchase APR to leave your payments in the bank longer and in doing so get interest revenue and rewards, I\u2019d go with the Citi Dividend World MasterCard or the Discover More Card because both offer rewards at least comparable to the Chase Freedom Visa and have 0% for longer."},{"date":"2011-12-07","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"Like with the Discover More credit cards, there are a few different Chase Freedom cards out there.  With the Chase Freedom Visa \u2013 As Low as 9.99% APR, Chase is obviously highlighting the card\u2019s regular APR, which means that this particular offer is targeted to people who don\u2019t want to be gouged in the months they aren\u2019t able to pay their balance in full.  This 9.99% APR Chase Freedom Card also offers rewards though, so it might catch your eye if you don\u2019t want to worry in months you can\u2019t pay, but usually do so and want to full get some free money from your spending.  Whether it will meet your needs obviously depends on the particular rewards this low interest Chase Freedom Visa offers and how they stack up against other offers available to people with excellent credit history.The card\u2019s rewards structure is pretty straightforward, you get a $50 cash bonus after your first purchase, 5% cash back on rotating spending categories that change on a quarterly basis, and 1% cash back on everything else.  This combination has become pretty standard in the current credit landscape, but it isn\u2019t necessarily as good as it seems.  It seems that you\u2019ll only get the 5% rate on $1,500 in charges each quarter and you have to sign up anew each quarter to even get that.  That means instead of getting convenience and more straightforward rewards (the supposed calling cards of cash back) with the Chase Freedom 9.99% APR offer, you get another quarterly obligation that comes with caveats.  If you forget to sign up for the 5% rate, you\u2019ll just have a 1% cash back card which isn\u2019t really competitive.  The same type of reasoning can be applied to the card\u2019s APR.  Just because it offers a rate AS LOW AS 9.99% doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get that rate.  In fact, only the people with the absolute best credit scores will be given it.  Your rate could end up being as high as 22.99% and you wont know what your in for at the time of application.  If it were me applying, I\u2019d decide whether a low interest rate is really a priority (If you pay your bill in full every month, it isn\u2019t).  If it isn\u2019t, instead of wasting time with this Chase Freedom 9.99% APR credit card offer, I\u2019d either get a good all-round rewards card that is inherently hassle free, like the Capital One Cash Credit Card (1.5% on all purchases) or the Venture Card (basically 2% cash back when miles redeemed for travel) or a card with the best rewards on my biggest expenses (preferably without a need to sign up for rotating categories).  If a low rate is a priority, then I\u2019d consider my credit standing and either apply for a card like the Chase Freedom Visa with a low best case scenario APR or a card with a lower high end rate."},{"date":"2011-12-01","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I\u2019ve never flown Continental Airlines, but if you have or do frequently you might be interested in the Continental Airlines OnePass Plus Credit Card.  This Continental Airlines Credit Card offers an initial rewards bonus of 30,000 miles (25,000 after you first use it and 5,000 after you add an authorized user; you have to do both within two months).  It also provides 10,000 bonus miles each year that you charge $25k.  Its regular rewards are 2 miles per $1 spent on Continental and United Airlines tickets and 1 mile per $1 spent on everything else.  The real question though is what you get with these miles.From a quick look at the Continental Airlines website, it looks like you can start getting free flights at 10,000 miles, but this lower end option is obviously a one-way economy fare for a domestic flight.  You can also redeem your Continental Airlines OnePass Plus Credit Card miles for rental cars and hotels or donate your miles to charity.  That\u2019s pretty standard for rewards credit cards though.  The other things you get with the Continental Airlines Credit Card are one free checked bag and priority boarding on Continental and United Airlines flights and two complimentary passes to the United Club each year.  While you can redeem miles for flights on any Star Alliance airline, it really only pays to apply for the Continental Airlines OnePass Plus Credit Card if you fly at least tens of thousands of miles with Continental or United each year because such flights are the only way you\u2019re going to get the 2 miles\/ 1 dollar spent and flying frequently is the only way you\u2019ll be able to benefit enough.  If you fly a lot but not always with Continental or United, I\u2019d recommend getting the Capital One Venture Card because it\u2019s basically a 2% cash back card if you redeem miles for travel related charges."},{"date":"2011-11-29","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"Whether you\u2019re a loyal Marriott customer or are simply in the market for a rewards credit card, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll come across the Marriott Rewards Premier Credit Card, as hotel credit cards and airline credit cards are typically quite popular amongst all consumers.  Whether or not you should apply for this Marriott Credit Card is another story entirely.  The two biggest considerations in making this decision are how the card stacks up against the rest of the rewards market and how often you will be able to redeem points.  First though you have to realize that you should only consider rewards cards if you have good credit or better and typically pay your bill in full on a monthly basis.  You really don\u2019t want to be turned down for a card or see the value of your rewards lessened by finance charges.  Once you cross that off this little checklist here, take a look at exactly what the Marriott Premier card offers:  50,000 bonus points after first use, 1 free night upon approval, 1 additional free night each year, 5 points per dollar spent at Marriott Hotels, 2 points per dollar spent on airline, dining and rental car purchases, and points toward Marriott Silver Status.  Just from this, it\u2019s abundantly clear that the Marriott Credit Card is intended for frequent travelers and you should have a sense of whether it\u2019s right for you.  Hotel-specific credit cards tend to offer very similar rewards structures, so deciding which one to get (if any) is really about which hotel you stay at most rather than which has slightly better rewards.  People who compare personal finance products (either professionally or for a hobby like me) typically recommend avoiding credit cards tied to particular companies unless you use that company\u2019s services multiple times per month because you want to be able to redeem your points frequently in order to benefit more often and avoid something called devaluation.  So unless you spend at least 20 nights in Marriott Hotels each year, you probably want to go for a good cash back card like the Capital One Cash Credit Card, which offers 1.5% cash back across all purchases.  Cash rewards are a lot less hassle and can easily be more lucrative than niche rewards cards like the Marriott Rewards Premier Credit Card."},{"date":"2011-11-14","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"A good rule of thumb for hotel rewards credit cards is to only get a card affiliated with a particular hotel if you stay at it almost exclusively.  One caveat to this rule is created by initial rewards bonuses, since you don\u2019t need to be a frequent patron to benefit from free nights doled out after account opening, first purchase or spending a certain amount in the first couple months.  That means there are two types of people for whom this Hyatt Credit Card could be a good fit, Hyatt loyalists and deal hunters.  Obviously the deal hunters would only really be interested in the two free nights the Hyatt Card provides, one after you make your first purchase and one after you spend $1,000 during the first three months.  These nights would be a big draw for Hyatt loyalists too, but they\u2019d also be interested to know that the Hyatt Credit Card offers 3 Hyatt Gold Passport Points for every dollar spent at Hyatt hotels and one for every dollar spent on everything else.  The real question though is how this card, which has a $75 annual fee and requires excellent credit, stacks up against the competition.  Seeing as the Marriott Credit Card offers up to 6 free nights in initial bonuses and a few other cards offer at least 2 free nights, the Hyatt Credit Card probably isn\u2019t your best bet if you don\u2019t have any allegiance to Hyatt hotels and only really want the most value from your card\u2019s initial bonus.  This is especially true, since a number of the other top tier hotel cards don\u2019t charge annual fees in the first year.  Hyatt loyalists obviously aren\u2019t going to get credit cards tied to other hotels, but they could decide to pass on the Hyatt Rewards Credit Card in favor of a generic hotel credit card or a cash back credit card.  Which you decide to do really depends on just how frequently you stay at Hyatt Hotels because if you\u2019re limiting your rewards to one type of purchase, this type of purchase had better be one of your top 2-3 expenses."},{"date":"2011-11-08","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"The British Airways Credit Card is an interesting product to watch, even if you don\u2019t regularly fly with BA.  While this would seem to violate the cardinal rules of rewards credit card selection (that you should only get a travel rewards card if you travel often and a card tied to a specific airline if you fly exclusively with it), the British Airways Card has proven to have some of the most attractive initial rewards bonuses available.  As of now, you can score a free transatlantic flight by opening this card, which has a $95 annual fee, and spending $2,500 in the first three months.  This alone is a good deal, but consider the fact that British Airways and Chase (the British Airways Credit Card\u2019s issuer) have offered 2 free transatlantic flights for a limited time before and your interest in the card will certainly increase.  Sure, there is no guarantee 2 free flights will be offered again anytime soon, but its something to watch out for, and one free flight is a pretty decent consolation prize.This is not to say that the British Airways Credit Card is only beneficial to consumers interested in nabbing an initial bonus and then closing their accounts.  It also offers 2.5 British Airways Miles for every $1 you spend with the air carrier, 1.25 miles on everything else and a free companion ticket for every year that you spend $30,000 on the card.  Plus, it doesn\u2019t have foreign transaction fees, making it well suited to overseas travel.  It is important to note that the BA Credit Card is a Visa Signature Card, which means it has the No Preset Spending Limit feature.  You must be careful with this type of card because Chase probably won\u2019t tell you what your spending limit is and might report misleading credit utilization to the major credit bureaus.  You don\u2019t want 1-2 free flights to cost you credit standing or make it difficult to plan large purchases, so inquiring with Chase about its NPSL policies before applying for the British Airways Credit Card is a good idea."},{"date":"2011-11-01","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"With the 2012 Presidential race heating up, I decided to take a look at a Presidential credit card, the Continental Airlines Presidential Plus Credit Card.  The first thing that stands out about this card is that it costs about as much as a Presidential Suite at a nice hotel, given that it has a $395 annual fee.  But do you get Presidential perks with this Continental Credit Card to warrant such high fixed costs?  Well, you do get full membership in the Continental Airlines Presidential Club, which allows you and family or you and two friends access to the United Club in airports and the usual free drinks, food and WiFi associated with airport lounges.  You also get a $95 bonus after you first use your Continental Airlines Presidential Plus Credit Card, which effectively reduces your annual fee to ONLY $395, as well as 2 miles per $1 spent on Continental Airlines purchases and 1 mile per $1 spent on everything else.  Each time you spend $5,000 the card, you also get 1,000 Elite Qualification Miles, which can help you attain or maintain Elite status.  If you have Elite status with Continental, opening the Presidential Club Credit Card inflates your already earned Elite Miles by 25%.  This might all seem like a lot, but is it really worth $300?  I\u2019d be inclined to say no.  The highlight of the Continental Airlines Presidential Plus Credit Card is the United longue access, but if you\u2019re going to travel enough to really make the most of lounge access, your miles will probably get you in anyway.  And if you don\u2019t travel frequently but like to do so in style, why not just purchase one-time access for $39?  Even if you\u2019re a frequent United flyer, I\u2019d still vote no on the Continental Airlines Presidential Plus Credit Card this year because the Continental Airlines One Plus Credit Card provides the same 2 miles\/$1 on United purchases as the Presidential Card as well as an attractive initial miles bonus and does not have an annual fee during the first year ($95 each year thereafter).  Sure, you only get one checked bag for free with the One Plus card (as opposed to two with the Presidential), but I\u2019m sure the $300 you save can comfortably cover that."},{"date":"2011-10-31","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"It\u2019s getting to be the time of the year when the Amazon.com and iTunes gift cards are passed around by friends and family members like Halloween candy, which made me wonder what the Amazon.com Credit Card has to offer.  Starting with the basics, the Amazon card is targeted to consumers with at least good credit, is on the Visa network, is issued by Chase Bank and does not have an annual fee.  When it comes to rewards, the Amazon.com credit card offers 3 points per $1 spent on Amazon, 2 points\/$1 spent at gas stations, restaurants and drug stores, and 1 point\/$1 spent on everything else, not to mention the $30 Amazon.com digital gift card you get for signing up.  There aren\u2019t any low introductory interests rates to speak of, only the advertised 13.24% - 21.24% variable APR range.  Applicants with higher scores would get rates on the lower end of this spectrum and vice versa.  It\u2019s pretty clear that whether or not the Amazon.com gift card is a good option for you depends on two things.  How much you already spend on Amazon.com and the rewards redemption policies associated with the card.  Unless a card has a really great initial rewards bonus, you want to get rewards cards tied to your biggest expenses.  This allows you to both earn as many points\/miles\/cash back as possible and redeem often.  With the Amazon credit card, 100 points equals $1 off an Amazon.com purchase, which means it is at best basically a 3% cash back card affiliated with a website, and at worst a 1% cash back card.  For the most diehard of Amazon.com shoppers, that\u2019s not too bad, but when you consider that other cards give you 1.5% \u2013 2% across all purchases, going in another direction might be the best move."},{"date":"2011-10-25","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":2,"review":"One would think that airlines would compete over everything, not just fare rates and baggage fees.  I mean, as members of the same industry and direct competitors you\u2019d think that companies like Southwest and United Airlines would strive to outdo each other in every way imaginable.  That\u2019s why I was hoping for more out of the United MileagePlus Explorer Credit Card.  Southwest Airlines is currently offering two free flights to new customers who sign up for the Southwest Rapid Rewards Plus Credit Card and make a single purchase with it.  Unfortunately, the United credit card only offers 25,000 bonus miles after first usage, which a quick look at United\u2019s Miles redemption policy reveals will only get you at most one free roundtrip flight.  Now, the United MileagePlus Credit Card doesn\u2019t have a first year annual fee, whereas the Southwest airlines card does ($69).  That, I suppose could impact the gap between the two cards in terms of worth, and if you are a frequent flyer of neither airline, your destination of choice and any differences between the two companies when it comes to the cities they fly to would probably be the tie breaker.Even if you are a loyal United patron, there are actually better options out there than the United Credit Card.  United recently struck a partnership with Chase that allows cardholders of certain Chase credit cards to freely transfer their rewards points to United MileagePlus Accounts.  Seeing as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card gives users 50,000 bonus points after they spend $3,000 during the first three months, you could simply get that card, transfer your points to a United Airlines account and have a chance at getting two free United flights if you opt for economy moneysaver fares on domestic flights."},{"date":"2011-10-21","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Chase Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"After hearing the news that Chase and United recently struck a deal which will allow Chase Sapphire Preferred customers free reign in transferring their points to United MileagePlus rewards program, I thought I have to check this card out.

The fact that the card doesn\u2019t have a first-year annual fee either means that you can open your card for as little or as much time (under a year, of course) as you want and still benefit without any fixed costs.
