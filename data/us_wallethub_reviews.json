They have literally shut my card down 5 times this year and NEVER contacted me.  So, here I am trying to buy something and my card gets declined.  That is so embarrassing!  I have talked to every supervisor and every department and it still doesn't work.  They shut my card down for a gas purchase or store purchase in the town where I live.  The last one was because I made five .99 cent purchases from Google in a row!!!  Why can't they just let me set a limit like my other banks???  Hey if there's a purchase of $500 or more in one day we'll shut it down.  Great!  No, they don't do that.  I will be closing my account and moving things over to my other bank.  I have avoided it until now as I have many auto-drafts which will take some time to set up in the new account, but I don't care anymore.  I am so sick of my card being shut off with NO warning.

Extremely unprofessional and ill-informed customer service reps. Each time you call they provide a different response as if rules change by the day at the bank. I called on Sep 3 to check on my pay-off statement as they had overcharged me on my PMI. The rep said they will generate a new pay-off factoring in my Aug payment which I made on Sep 1 and it will be generated in 24 hours and will be faxed to my new mortgage provider and emailed to me as well. I called up on Sep 4 to follow up as I hadn't received any email statement. The rep that day said it was a misinformation and they take 72 hours to generate the payoff statement and not 24 hours. I called up on Sep 7 and asked for my statement over email while I was on the call, the rep that day emailed me the statement and when I checked it was the same amount as earlier and they added an extra $20 for the statement FAX charges. When I asked. the rep said the Aug PMI payment isn't factored in until mid-September so the amounts are same. If this is the case why didn't the 1st rep I spoke with on 3 Sep tell me that? I wouldn't have asked for the statement to be faxed again in that case and wouldn't have to pay extra charges for the same statement. Glad I am over with them. Not sure how much I need to follow up to refund my overcharged PMI payments. They need to have a log of what interactions were done by which rep with each customer else there is simply no accountability and each rep provides their own information per convenience and customer is at a loss."},{"date":"2021-09-04","name":"John Chambers","user_id":"johnc5","verified":true,"product":"U.S. Bank Mortgages","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"We paid off this loan in Aug. 2021 .

They only allow you go so far into a negative balance and that amount is different for everyone, usually based on off how much is deposited regularly. Also you will be charged an overdraft fee regardless if the bank pays it or not. \nYou can call to see if they'll waive the fee though after the fact. If they don't you may have a better chance going into your local branch and asking. A couple years ago i was struggling to get by and i had taken all the coins i could find to branch to avoid getting an overdraft fee. At that point i had already had quite a few throughout that year and i just was over it. The coins ended up not being enough and i was going to get 3 fees that day alone. I figured I'd ask the branch manager if they could help just so i wouldn't get the new fees that day. They ended up crediting 6 overdraft fees from previous months so not only did i avoid the 3 fees that wouldve been charged, i ended up with a decent credit back. \nLuckily I've been able to stay ahead even with the pandemic but I'd like to think banks will help with waiving a fee... certainly doesnt hurt to ask."},{"date":"2021-07-26","name":"michelle_lacy","user_id":"michelle_lacy","verified":false,"product":"U.S. Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"If I could give US bank -1 stars I would.

Astoundingly, US Bank provided the fraudster with the account number for our joint checking account (not the account for which they had stolen the checkbook) and the fraudster withdrew $5,000 from our joint account. Just an hour later, the fraudster drove to another US Bank location nearby and repeated this, taking another $5,000 (for a total of $10,000). There were no red flags issued and no security questions asked. The fraudster tried this again at a third US Bank location, but this time the teller noticed the fraudster's wig and called the police. The fraudster drove off immediately. When we tried to investigate, US Bank told us they do not have security cameras on the drive through lanes at these locations (only the ATMs) and they had no video footage of the fraudster. US Bank ultimately reimbursed us after 5 weeks (kind of a long wait). I was shocked, however, that US Bank's security at drive through lanes is so lax. Apparently, the fraudster needed only my wife's driver's license to unlock our bank account. And what kind of financial institution has no security cameras on the drive through lanes in 2020?"},{"date":"2021-06-06","name":"Dax","user_id":"daxb","verified":true,"product":"U.S. Bank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"This is the AAA credit card, The website is fine, nothing special but it works.

It was a like a bad comedy. First, no auto acknowledgment from US bank that my application was received. Four days later an email tells me I need an EIN even though Phone support that I had called in advance assured me that my SSN was perfectly adequate. Two more days to ensure that they need it. So I established an EIN with the IRS even though the IRS does not require that I have one. Gave that info to US Bank. Got an email back asking for permission to use the EIN I just gave them.  Really? Isn't that clearly why I sent it? I see that the $100 to fund this new account processed from my personal, non-business account that same day. So I'm clearly near the finish line - right? Wrong! Four days later I get an email - my application creation failed due to a system failure. I can apply again. No mention about my $100. I ask the US Bank rep I've been in contact with previously what the heck is going on? He says he'll have me approved 24 hours if I re-apply. Sounds like a good customer service attempt. I roll the dice and re-apply.  I also ask him how do I get my $100 back since I had to re-fund this new application? Sure enough, next day I get an approval notice. I click the links to login to my account first time. Says I need my account number . The account they sent was like ********1234 - incomplete. Presumably because email is insecure. Fair enough, but how can I access my account? So I call my US Bank rep. He's not allowed to give the account number over phone. Also, he was unable to put the previous $100 into this new account? He'll work on getting that returned to me. I guess they expect people to wait another 10-14 days for the U.S. mail to arrive - like my account number is super secure via U.S. mail delivery. But if that is their expectation, they should at least say so in their email. I actually have no information telling me how to get my account number.  BTW, my account number will be on all of my checks if I write any. It isn't a big secret - right? Anyway, the rep refers me to their Business Service Center. The hold recording tells me to expect a 30 minute wait. I stay on hold for over an hour and am never picked up. I'm done!So I emailed the US Bank my rep and told him to close the not-exactly-opened account and get me my $200 back.  I then went, in person, to another bank and was all set up with an account,  account number and courtesy checks in about an hour. Online account access is supposed to be delayed another 48 hours or so. Business accounts are more complicated than personal accounts. But still, this was pretty simple.US Bank might be an OK small business checking bank if you just apply in person. But they haven't figured out online application for business accounts well at all. Even if everything went perfectly according to their plan, this was destined to be frustrating at best. Poor support. Systems don't provide status feedback via automated emails. Only saving grace was I did have a personal contact - but he's handcuffed by their poor system.  BTW, BBVA was worse - but I gave up sooner on them. Establish business checking in person.

When I opened this account I went to the branch twice, first was to add my husband on my checking account and provided all our information and signature. Then after about a week they closed my savings account that was open over the phone because they said there was no signature. No one has even bothered to reach out to us about the form that needed our signature and the fact that we went to the branch after opening that account, the person at the bank didn't even mention that to us. After this incident, I went to the branch to ask for a limit increase on my debit card spending, and she said you should be receiving a decision if it is approved or not, and again they failed to do that. I can just go on and on with not just once, not twice, but many more incidents that I never felt valued as a customer. I have been with Capital One for so many years and never had this bad experience. It is just because they don't have a branch here, so I decided to open US bank.

Since I am traveling with my job and not home, she said I would have to change my address and she would cancel my card and reissue me a new one. I didn\u2019t know the address for the motel I\u2019m staying in so I asked if I could get that information and call back and when I called back five minutes later, the second person that took my call said that I have to go online to change my address and then I have to wait 5 business days before I can request a new card !!!

The process itself has been strung out over two months. (Keep in mind, these funds are to meet emergency bills such as rent and groceries. By the time anyone actually receives their assistance they are far too late to even help meet basic needs.)I have started calling in on a daily basis because the information I receive is so conflicting. Every agent I speak with tells me something different, including the supervisors. Each time I call in I am told that there is something different restricting my account. No matter what I am told, any time I fax in what they say I am missing or contact my state or do any of a vast number of things I have been told that I need to do, the problem is never resolved and they just change what they say is the problem the next time so that they never have to release my funds.I have tried to explain to the supervisors that their agents are not following a consistent protocol because no matter how many times I call in I am given different, often completely false information by their customer service representatives. However, no one is taking any responsibility for this information. The supervisors just say, \"I don't know why they said that\" or \"I have nothing to do with that\". In addition, twice now the supervisors have pretended to transfer me and then hung up on me. I worked in a call center during my college years--I know what fake hang ups sound like on the phone when pretending to transfer. I have told them over and over they need to go back and listen to my calls to hear what their agents are saying and to retrain them instead of just denying responsibility for their agents' actions. However, they refuse to do this.My state gave US Bank over $4,000 that they were supposed to distribute to me in unemployment. What a joke. I don't where all their funds end up sitting long term when they restrict access for months on end but they definitely are not going to the people the state designated that money for.This pandemic has been excruciatingly painful for our economy and our households. I hope if any other states have been considering US Bank Reliacard as their means of distributing funds that this is just one of many voices begging them to reconsider. I am daily losing hope of ever receiving the funds that I payed into for unemployment and am left just praying that God somehow intervenes to cover my emergency bills."},{"date":"2020-10-25","name":"Dara Roy","user_id":"dararoy750","verified":false,"product":null,"review_comment":true,"stars":0,"review":"This bank is absolutely incompetent and I\u2019m going to go all the way to the top with the people who have a voice and authority to make some critical changes since they have proven that they aren\u2019t capable of handling Oregonian money that families receive from unemployment, child support, and who knows what other critical types of currency exchange accounts millions of people receive money through!

USB pushes us to setup automated payments to obtain a lower rate. They do this so they can easily increase their interest payment pull from the monthly  payment. How? They only allow this to be made on the due date, not the statement date.

We made an offer nearly 2 weeks ago, that was above listing price.  We offered cash terms and short closing window. In the market where we live, there is presently a sellers market and a shortage of homes for sale.  When we made our offer we were aware that multiple offers might be made on this property.  Nonetheless, we received a verbal counter offer that was not acceptable to us, but our agent discussed the offer with the seller's agent and we were left with the impression that one key element of the offer would ensure an acceptable offer.  So we included that in our counter offer, confident that we were negotiating genuinely and would soon hear a positive response from the selling agent.  Nothing but crickets since then, over a week.  We learned today that it is suspected that the seller is playing multiple buyers, and will soon finally select the buyer they choose to work with and tell the others that their (counter) offers are declined.  Offhand it would appear that US Bank intentionally included a stipulation in their original counteroffer that they knew would be unacceptable to most potential buyers (VERY short due diligence period) so the buyer would make another counteroffer which the bank could then decline without another counteroffer.  We didn't agree to the short due diligence period in our counteroffer, so it became unacceptable for US Bank should they decide to accept another offer instead of ours. This process has prevented us from negotiating on other properties (since we consider ourselves ethically bound by the offer we have made, apparently not like US Bank's unethical practice of leading multiple buyers to believe their offer is genuinely being considered when in reality they are just holding out for the better offer just around the corner).  It has also left a bad taste in my mouth regarding US Bank and I will avoid future interactions with this company.I have an understanding of how to do my own online research to determine owners of properties listed for sale, and I will avoid dealing with properties showing US Bank as trustee or seller."},{"date":"2020-07-17","name":"msladybabe01","user_id":"msladybabe01","verified":false,"product":"U.S. Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"I really dislike US bank!

In the end, a general statement from U.S. Bank \"We regret to learn of the difficulties you have encountered as a result of the COVID- 19 pandemics\" but based on the agreement the decision was still made to decrease my credit line that directly affected my overall credit score. I paid for my late payments with the assessed late fees applied. I find this action not empathetic, as a large company,understanding the struggles of their customers.

I have had no response to that email.So I escalated it and filled a complaint with the CFPB and mentioned the fact that the institution extorting fees from accounts in this current situation--especially when most other businesses are waving fees, is in very poor taste.

Their bankers are just pretentious when it comes to customer service. Every year I swear they upcharge the overdraft fee as well, because when I first signed up it was only about $15.

Given I only use the checking accounts as my personal spending accounts since this bank is not local for me. My main accounts I have are elsewhere, but I wanted to test the limits of this bank since I was considering them for a prospect mortgage. So, I decided to test my limits with the US Bank checking accounts and really give this bank a try before possible moving everything to US bank. I did this by making a deposit into both of my accounts at the max daily limit. Which was 2,500.00 in one checking account and another 2,500.00 in the other checking account. Another full disclosure, this was the first deposit I made. Because again, these accounts were not my primary account and I really wanted to test my limits. I anticipated the obvious, \u201ca hold\u201d. But, since the checks I deposited were local and a largely known bank, I didn\u2019t anticipate a 10-day hold. All and all, I was fine with that. Until not only did they not inform me of the hold, they disabled my online and mobile access, locked both my debit cards, and even after the 10 day hold and long after the checks cleared\/funds obtained by US Bank, they still kept these status on both my accounts.  At this point, I\u2019m pissed! Because I have now called US Bank three times now. The first time to inquire why I can\u2019t access my account. A second time five days (3 business days) after I knew the check should have cleared US Bank. Which in fact did, and US Bank confirmed and offered to transfer me to the fraud department to have the hold taken off. But I didn\u2019t have time to speak to the fraud department at that time and was told that the hold was fall off after 10 days. So, I decided to just wait. So here it is, 11 days of not having access to any of my accounts, funds reflecting in US Bank, and still no access. I called customer service to ask why the hold didn\u2019t fall off automatically. No answer. I asked him to please remove the hold since clearly the checks aren\u2019t fraudulently. He answered, \u201cwe here at customer service have limited access and can\u2019t remove the hold\u201d. I further explain the situation and ask, why wasn\u2019t I told this from the other two people I\u2019ve spoken with. And then I proceeded to the next basic request, please transfer me to the department that has access to remove the hold. His response was unfortunately, you will need to go to your local branch in person to have this removed. I informed him that this bank is not local. He replied, they \u201cmay\u201d be able to help you over the phone. He further read generic responses as why he can\u2019t help me as well as refused (I asked at least 7 times) to transfer me to management. So, let me summarize. At this point, US Bank is basically holding my account on lock down without any cause or reasoning, still without any access, refused to take the off the hold of my money, refused to give me an explanation of what\u2019s going on, refused to transfer me to management, and only thing I got was a phone number to branch that I\u2019ve never been because the account was opened online. This is a very long review and my first review I\u2019ve ever written. But this bank is so horrible, it literally drove me to write this review. I couldn\u2019t rest without getting this voiced and hope no one else have to experience this unnecessary &amp;amp;#*!.Oh, if you\u2019re wondering if this resolved, I\u2019ll be calling the branch tomorrow and shortly after closing everything I have with them.

The only bright spot is the staff at this branch, who were lovely, but can't overcome the disaster that is US Bank.  When I opened the account (at the branch), it took a while, and rather than keep them past closing time, I told them they could just send me my debit card and PIN, which I didn't want anyway.  What they apparently didn't know was that without a PIN, you can't set up your online account or anything else, as it is core to their security protocols.  When the password I was given for the online account didn't work, I was stuck.   After many phone calls trying to get that straightened out, I gave up and waited for the PIN to arrive.  Then it didn't work.  More calls, more snail mail, finally got a PIN that worked.Then began the saga of trying to get my nonprofit accountant set up for shared access to my account.  Turns out US Bank had just released an updated web process for that, and it didn't actually work (and they acknowledged this).  Apparently they don't actually test features before releasing them.  Six times I had to register her for access, then discover that the system had messed up, then unregister her.  Many, many hours spent with Customer Service.  Finally, after several weeks, my accountant was able to log in to my account, only to discover that she did not have access to my bank statements.  I called Customer Service again to discover that US Bank does not include bank statements in shared access.  They allow access to all individual transactions, but not to statements!  No one could explain this idiotic policy.  So that was the last straw for me.

I have been a member for several years with no issues until a month ago. I first noticed that the app I used to make payments was down due to technical issues; I was told to call customer service for assistance or try again later. I was also unable to make a payment using the online banking website due to technical issues. So, around 12\/11\/18, I called the 24-hour customer service line and was on hold for over 20 minutes until I was connected to a representative. During the call, I made a payment, and was also informed that my card had been shut down due to fraudulent activity. I waited for my new card to be mailed to me a few days later, and I immediately activated the new card and mailed in the requested documentation about the fraud. During these past weeks, I still have been unable to manage my account using the app or the online banking website due to technical difficulties. (My bank account is not an available payment method; when I try to add it, the website says that it's already added, but I cannot access it). Today, almost a month after the initial call to customer service to make a payment, my card is still declined when I try to use it and I am still unable to manage my account using the app or online banking website. I called the 24-hour customer service line today to get assistance with the technology to manage my account and with my card itself, and I was on hold for over 1 hour and 15 minutes before finally giving up. I have neither the time nor the phone battery power to obtain assistance. I have spent hours of my time and still have not been able to solve the technical issues or the account issues, AND I have been deprived of increased dividend due to my REI shopping during the holidays.

Was mainly excited about the bike but hey ill take another card to thicken my credit profile.... well got the card in the mail and big whop 500 dollar limit.... you'd figure if they let you finance a $16,000 dollar bike they would give you a half decent CL.... So I've been more vigilant with my scores lately as I'm hoping to buy a home in the coming months and could not for the life of me figure out the reporting date. One would assume they would report the closing date balance like every other card I've ever owned....WRONG they not only could not tell me when they report but it hasn't been the same date for the past 3 months. I called to try and get an actual reporting date since it wasn't my statement closing date or my due date. Was first met with a rude woman who insisted that they report between the 1st and the 6th of every month which i replied mine reported the 28th so that's not true. Finally was able to talk to a supervisor after more rude attitude and less answers from the first woman. He replied that they are not allowed to disclose the reporting date to their customers because they don't want people to \"game\" the credit score....... 1st off how is this even legal?! That they can just throw a dart at a calendar and go that day works for reporting,and secondly \"gaming\" the credit score???? I don't follow, i use the card heavily every month which credit companies want for the fees and or interest and then i should be rewarded via credit score for paying monthly (in full) those charges on time....how is this gaming??? So ultimately unless i carry a zero balance or low balance at all times i risk the chance of them choosing a day to report me while I'm carrying a high balance. Yes could i sit here for the next 6 months and try and figure out a pattern sure but that's not worth my time for a 500 limit card with points that i couldn't use to buy a pair of gloves... Save your time and get AMEX or discover or just any other card that actually will give you a decent limit and report your balance on your statement closing date."},{"date":"2018-10-02","name":"princetonepps5","user_id":"princetonepps5","verified":false,"product":null,"review_comment":true,"stars":1,"review":"Horrible BankI've been a customer in 3 different branches of this bank in 2 different states.

When he called, he was told that they had sent a replacement card to our old address on August 20, 2018. They never deactivated his current card he had on-hand. However, today, Sept. 16, 2018, when he called to update our change of address and was notified they had sent the new card to the wrong address, the man on the phone said he was going to \"fast track\" a new card to our current address and it should be here in 2-3 days. The man never mentioned he would be deactivating my husband's current card, therefore he never took money out of the ATM to get us through the next few days. We have two children to feed and send lunches to school with, he has no gas to get to work and our fridge is empty. Now, upon finding out his card had been deactivated, he spent 3+ hours on the phone with different customer service representatives and had nothing but rude, inconsiderate, incompetent assholes. One never even attempted to contact a manager\/higher ranking employee, another transferred him to the \"Authorization Department\" which you have to visit your local branch to get a card authorized, and another one had him on the phone for over an hour until they finally said \"I can activate it for gas but that's it.\" So, after being given the run-around for hours on end, he is told that the card he has in his hand was reported \"lost\/stolen.\" The card was not reported \"lost\/stolen\". His mother works with multi-million dollar stock market accounts and things like that with this company and she notified him that that stunt was to cover their own ass. These people did not care to notify him his card was being deactivated so therefore he did not prepare to not have access to his money for the next 2-3 days. They did not care to let him know that he should pull money before they deactivated the card. They did not make the effort to rectify this situation at all. They are incompetent asshats, give no shits about their customers or their families, and make no effort to own up to their own wrong doings. They did not deactivate when the first replacement was sent to the wrong address, so why deactivate after the fact? This company has the worst customer care I have ever seen in all my years of dealing with banking systems. I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy and if you care about your financial well being, I would not EVER give this company access to my money or personal information.

Furthermore, when you choose a large, older brick & mortar bank, you expect consistency, the opportunity for growth, & a trustworthiness that can often only be found with years of wisdom garnered from past mistakes.You get none of this US Bank & to add insult to injury, it is your fault entirely for even placing them on such a figmented pedestal. Imagine my surprise to hear that there is nothing they can do to intervene in the automated actions of their 3rd party managed ATM\u2019s. Imagine my shock when their glorified sales rep (they refer to themselves as \u201cBanker\u2019s\u201d) place the blame solely on me for expecting to be warned (JUST warned) about a $1200 check suddenly being reversed & overdrafting my account simply because I\u2019m in the middle of a name change (nevermind the fact that it still had my husband\u2019s name on it as well & that our account is joint).

What\u2019s crazy is that these people honestly believe that because of $90 worth of transactions going through (which again, should have been declined- oh don\u2019t worry, they now made sure to click that option for me this time! So no big!\/s) it\u2019s entirely justified to STEAL $180 even though it sat negative for all of TWO FUCKING DAYS.Ladies & gentlemen, not even WELLS FARGO, the king of banking horror stories, did this to me.

I expect to be treated like a number, I expect fees when I make mistakes, what I DO NOT expect from a PHYSICAL BANK that I can go into is the lack of help, transparency, & theft I\u2019ve been provided with despite the 4 years of WEEKLY direct deposits (every Friday) my husband & I have made!Oh, this is rich too, one day, for no particular reason at all, US Bank closed our savings account even though we\u2019d just had about $1k in it a couple weeks prior & were about to put more in.

I have no idea & neither do any of the reps! I would ask a qualified banker, but the THREE times I\u2019ve put in a request, nobody calls us back! & remember, those \u201cbankers\u201d they have at each location... they\u2019re sterile sales people!

Before leaving you grabbed the wrong ATM card for your business checking account and you don\u2019t have any checks.  When you call your bank desperately in need of help getting access to your funds, they cut you off at the knees and completely disable your account with no notice instead of calling you.  They then don\u2019t call you back for two weeks letting all your payments bounce and ruining your credit, THEN they tell you they can\u2019t help you and you need to fly 2100 miles to walk into a branch, which you can\u2019t do because the only funds you have left are in your business checking account.  This is what Randy Knotson (the manager at the business \u201cservice\u201d center) and Tawnie Finn (branch manager at the La Brea branch in LA) did to me and they\u2019ve yet to fix it.  I\u2019m an IT contractor who travels for work and uses his business checking account to get paid.  Sometimes I work as a W2 employee so my business checking account goes unused for long periods of time between contracts.  Before leaving my home, I could not find my debit card or checks, but I checked google and it looked like there was a US Bank branch near my work in Manhattan.  Clients are regularly slow to pay me for the first time and travel is expensive (I was traveling with my family this time as I have a new 1 year old), so it\u2019s regular for my funds to be depleted to a critical state and my credit cards nearing their max by the first payment.  To my dismay, it was two months before this first payment, plus Google was outdated and there is no branch in New York at all, or any state I could drive to in a reasonable amount of time.I called the business \u201cservice\u201d center in a state of panic needing new check books or a check card or something as I really needed to pay bills at this point.  They said I\u2019d have to change my address, so I changed my address.  Then the business \u201cservice\u201d center then told me I\u2019d have to wait 30 days now to get checks (would have been nice if they told me this before\u2026could have had someone go to my house on the west coast and send them to me).  I\u2019m with my wife, child, and just spent $20K moving us to New York\u2026I don\u2019t have 30 days to wait, I\u2019m out of money now.  So I asked if they could wire transfer or ACH money to people I\u2019m desperately behind with.  This is not an unusual request for most banks, but apparently the \u201cservice\u201d center at US Bank saw this as some sort of security breech so they locked my account.  I can no longer use Pay Pal or anything from the account\u2026it\u2019s totally locked.  I cannot fly to a state with a branch, I\u2019m almost completely out of money.  I\u2019ve been able to buy over a million dollars\u2019 worth of property with bank funds with notarized identification\u2026I\u2019ve never met a mortgage banker personally.  I spent countless hours calling the business \u201cservice\u201d center.  Randy Knotson is the manager there and I was told several times he was the one who made the decision to keep my account locked these past two weeks.  I\u2019ve left countless messages with him and he has yet to call me back.  Tawnie Finn tells me I can walk into the branch in Los Angeles with my ID and she\u2019d un-freeze my account, but if she has the power to do this, why can\u2019t she accept a notarized letter like EVERY OTHER BANK ON THE PLANET?  Why can I buy a house this way, but I can\u2019t unlock my own funds?  Tawnie tells me repeatedly that it\u2019s Randy\u2019s decision, but she won\u2019t conference in Randy so we can get to the bottom of it.

I often don't realize my card is frozen until my wife and I try to use the account again, in which we can't because we have to call in to verify that we attempted to make purchases or made purchases days prior.

Soon I will have no business or funds going through US Bank, they lack intelligent employees whom can't do their jobs, their customer service is horrendous, and they attempt to control when and where you can make purchases(free country?).

In the last few months it wouldn't giver a point balance. For over a year she couldn't access the point balance website as it would not give her any detailed information.  She called numerous times on this problem and NOTHING was done nor accomplished it fell on deaf ears!!!!  The customer service reps are in Alabama and are horrendous to deal with.  The were EXTREMELY rude, inefficient, unprofessional and other nouns I cannot say as they would be inappropriate to put down.  It was not only the reps but the supervisors as well.  It has been very discouraging, frustrating and I am begging you to NOT get the prepaid card it will only be aggravation. On December 23rd of 2015 she called about unrecognizable charge and inquired on the protocol to dispute the charge; the inept agent told her that they have to shutdown her card, I quote her she told them \"NO!!THAT CAN'T HAPPEN!!!DON'T DO IT!!!\"  She went to the store put funds on her card which they gladly did and than went and got her items went to pay for them and she couldn't.  She called customer service and they told her that her card had been shut down.  She was told in the Terms and Conditions they can shutdown her card at ANY TIME!!!!!  She called customer service back and begged them to release the card to no avail they DID NOTHING but were robots \"I am sorry\" \"Sorry for the inconvenience\"!!!!!!!  At one point in the four years of her having this card she dealt with a Nancy Fields and Greg Thompson a Fry's Personal Finance and they are diabolical don't return calls...blah blah blah....  So my wife spoke to Greg Thompson and explained everything at which point she was hysterical.  She called every 15 minutes and he COMPLETELY blew her off and never called back!!!!

His only explanation for me having received prior approval was that his customer service representative was unaware of the Bank's policy. He assured me I would be able to use it at my other destinations. I borrowed-money to pay my bills and planned to get cash and repay the loans in Thailand. Upon arrival in Thailand I tried to get cash at the airport, and again my card was declined. From the hotel I called Bank U S. (Still no working toll free number.) The representative asked me if I had made a purchase in Luxembourg. I said no and pointed out that Luxembourg was not on the itinerary I had provided; but, Thailand was. He told me he would have to terminate my card; and mail me a new one. Of course I would not be able to use it until I returned home. The inconvenience this level of incompetence has caused me, not to mention embarrassment and the inability to buy souvenirs and pay my expenses, made me realize this card cannot service my needs.

We also use encryption program for all our online accounts.

Everythime we called, we were placed on hold for 15- 30 minutes at a time (even for making payments) and the managers in the call center were rude and unappologetic. What was worst, they changed the story about how our date was compromised 2 times: at first, it sounded like it was their fault for sending a card there (and we do agree they did it way to easily); but after that, they started blaming us. Last call with the manager Dina was the worst: \"we are going to block you for making payments every time\". \"Your data was stolen and it is not our fault \"(aka it is not the credit card company's fault for sending  a card to a different state, for adding another person we a different last name on the account account AND for allowing the address to be also changed at the same time).

US Bank sent a text alert of a check I'd forgotten about, and I was able to rush to the bank and make a deposit to cover it. Any other bank would have charged an NSF fee (even if you made a deposit immediately), but US Bank's policy is if you make a deposit to cover it before 5pm that same day, you're good. That peace of mind alone would make me want to stay with them, but the fact that all their tellers and managers are always so friendly and helpful cements the deal. US Banks online banking, online bill pay and website work well, which I also can't say for other banks. They also don't play games with my deposits (yes, I'm looking at you, BofA).

This card does not offer rewards, such as cash back for purchases, which is a major drawback for many card users. However, if you have excellent credit, as is required for using this card, having the funds to make purchases and payments isn't an issue. The interest rates are low, with 0% for the first 15 months you use the card. Based on your creditworthiness, you may start with a rate of 10% after that period, which is fairly competitive. Some smaller, lesser-known cards offer slightly lower rates, but can be harder to get. Additionally, there is no annual fee.If you have a US Bank account, you can view current statements, account history, make a payment from your U.S. Bank Checking or Savings account. There is a 24 day grace period, $0 fraud liability, Fraud Protection, and online account alerts. One's credit limit can be raised over time, and shouldn't be lower than what one needs to start with. Customer service for this card is generally good, with help knowing what to do and helping resolve the issue. US Bank also offers additional benefits. One is FlexControl, which is a free online tool that can help you avoid interest fees and late fees with automatic payments. This is designed to help you pay a balance faster. U.S. Bank also has Overdraft Protection, which can automatically transfer funds from a U.S. Bank Visa Platinum account into your checking account. Balance Transfers to a U.S. Bank Visa from higher interest rate credit accounts are also possible. Online banking customers can receive an  Experian credit score for free. while this is nice, it leaves out reports compiled by TransUnion and Equifax, the other two major credit bureaus. Consequently, it is not going to be a complete overview of your creditworthiness, and it is recommended to check your FICO score and Vantage Score as well, as they are the two most widely-used scores. Last, cardholders can pay bills online to a variety of companies that do not normally accept credit cards including insurance companies, electric utilities, and telephone service providers. This bill pay service is free.A drawback of the card is the Balance transfer fee. The U.S. Bank Visa Platinum Card charges a 3 percent balance transfer fee, something that other cards do not. Also, this 3 percent fee is only for the first 30 days. The card also offers car rental insurance is useful, but this benefit is also available with many other credit cards, and has been known to have strict rules that, if not followed, can cause confusion. If you have fair credit and are looking to pay off large credit card balances, can deal with the transfer fee, and appreciate a free credit score, this card is a good choice. If you have excellent credit and little to no credit card debt, a card with a rewards program is a better option."},{"date":"2014-11-21","name":"Pamela Colliver","user_id":"pamela.colliver","verified":false,"product":"U.S. Bank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":".....for the love of God and also that you are a very smart consumer and credit card participant.

Until recently, this bank had a reserve line of money (a sort of cash advance) that went along with the checking account. I used this often due to the expenses of college.

This bank no longer has that type of service with the checking account but it is still available in another service which I use because I can rely on it.

Since I could not go to the bank in person to put money into the account, I had to transfer money from my other checking account at Nevada State Bank into the US Bank account. In order to do that, Nevada State had to make two small deposits and withdrawals to verify my US Bank account. Since my US Bank account with in the negative, when Nevada State withdrew those two small deposits, I was charged fees for both of those withdrawals as well! I called US Bank and talked to the manager. I told her my predicament, and told her there was no way that I could have fixed this situation any other way, being out of state, and I didn't think that it was fair that I was charged two outrageous fees for those tiny (like 5 cent) verification withdrawals. The manager told me there was nothing she could do about it, and she acted like she did not care at all about my problem. So I told her to close my account and that I was reporting them to the BBB. I did report them to the BBB, and after that, I received a credit for those two fees I had incurred.

This was not something that was disclosed in my agreement at the time of opening so please be sure to check at your local branch.  Other than that the only other issues I have is with the app.  To deposit a check via the app it charges $0.50 per check.  This may not be much but other banks do not charge this fee. Every problem or question I have ever had has been resolved promptly and accurately.  I now hold a savings and checking account with this bank.  There are also perks.

Apparently not, so I am shopping it with other mortgage companies and giving US Bank a negative rating for such a simple customer service blunder."},{"date":"2013-12-09","name":"Sean Hockin","user_id":"sean.hockin","verified":false,"product":"U.S. Bank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"The Kroger 123 Rewards card is an overall wonderful value for the customer.

The Kroger 123 Rewards card is a very attractive card for those who are fortunate to own it. You earn rewards points every time you use this card and accumulate them at faster rates if you use the card in the Kroger store (and at an even greater rate if you purchase Kroger brand products while there). This allows you to earn up to 3 points per dollar spent. At 1000 points you get $5 in free groceries. My wife and I usually spend from $50-$100  weekly the grocery store. Even if we didn't buy Kroger brand and only qualified for 2 points\/dollar spent there, so that means we could accumulate up to 200 points a week at the store (on non-Kroger brand items alone). In 5 weeks we earn back $5, so over the course of a year that is about $50 saved by using this card. It's not amazing savings, but for a family that spends much more than us and used Kroger brand items these savings could be much greater. The rate is variable, so those with good credit scores will have it the best, so everyone must consider what is best for their own situation. Still, for a \"store card\" these rates are competitive. People with large families could save quite a bit of money with this card if they like to shop at Kroger. It's certainly worth it for them in my opinion."},{"date":"2013-11-15","name":"Ana Benjamin","user_id":"ab117","verified":false,"product":"U.S. Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I have been a U.S. Bank customer for 5 years now and I have never had a problem with them.

Harley-Davidson Secured Credit Card gives you protection against fraud, so if it is stolen, no sweat and is a nice feature to have.

I understand other cards do give you rewards for more than just the place it came from, but since I'm using the card only at Ace, it makes sense that the rewards are directed towards the store. So far I figure I've saved around $20 which isn't too bad at all. I pay it off each month and that's that.

I was exasperated, and thought it was a joke, but she refused to exchange the money. I stated very clearly 'So you expect me to hand you 5 dollars, and I will have no pennies in return?', and she said 'yes'; that she could not change their policy. I followed this up with a call to the branch manager, mostly because I wanted to share how ridiculous it was, and he apologized and said it was a lack of training about their policies to the employee.

I feel bad for anyone out there who needs to build up their credit score but either hasn\u2019t yet come across the Harley Davidson Secured Credit Card or just overlooked it because of its motorcycle branding.  I mean, the Harley Davidson Card is the best secured credit card on the market, in my opinion.  Here\u2019s why:Background:- Secured credit cards are generally recognized as the best credit building vehicles because they report to the major credit bureaus and tend to have lower fees as well less strict approval criteria than other cards targeted to people with no credit or damaged credit.  The reason for that is you\u2019re required to place a refundable security deposit that acts as your credit line, preventing you from spending more than you can afford to pay back and shielding the issuer from risk.- Nevertheless, most secured cards charge tens of dollars in annual fees, and rewards are virtually unheard of in this card segment.-The biggest priority for secured card users is to minimize costs in order to save as much money as possible for when they can actually get attractive rewards and low rates (you often have to pay an annual fee to get the best terms, even when you have excellent credit).Harley Card:- The Harley Davidson Secured Credit Card does not charge an annual fee, which means it offers free credit building.  It\u2019s the only secured card issued by a major bank (as opposed to a credit union) that does not charge an annual fee.- The Harley Card also gives you some rewards on each dollar you spend.- U.S. Bank (the issuer of the Harley Davidson Secured Card) will automatically review your account for a potential upgrade after 12 months of responsible use.- You can place a deposit between $300 and $5,000.  The ability to essentially give yourself that much available credit (remember, your deposit equals your credit line) means you can boost your credit building efforts at will.Who should use it:Secured cards are generally best for people who haven\u2019t had much experience using credit or who\u2019ve made mistakes in the past.  For those in the \u201cinexperienced\u201d bucket, it\u2019s important to note that you might want to check out a good unsecured card for newcomers (such as the Capital One Cash Rewards for Newcomers Card) or a student credit card first and only apply for a secured card if you don\u2019t get approved or want some forced spending discipline.  If you have \u201cbad\u201d credit, a secured card is likely your best bet.  The only caveat is if you need an emergency line of credit (for example, to pay car bills in order to get to work).  The Harley Davidson Card, like most other secured cards, won\u2019t help in that regard because you\u2019re putting down the money for your credit line.  The Capital One Secured Card could be of help because it\u2019s a partially secured card, which means the credit line for which you\u2019re approved might exceed your deposit.  Otherwise, you\u2019re stuck with an unsecured credit card for bad credit."},{"date":"2013-01-11","name":"Jerrica","user_id":"Jerrired","verified":false,"product":"U.S. Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I opened an account with U.S Bank when I started college because it was the official bank of my college.

I've been to different branches of U.S Bank all over Illinois and at each one of them I received the same generosity and helpfulness. I have had a couple major financial\/banking issues since I opened my account and each time the clerks have been very useful in helping me fix it.The only drawback that U.S Bank has is that they often do things without fully informing me or explaining to me why it was done. One of the bank tellers when I opened up a new account asked if I needed checks. He told me he would send me a set for free, but I found out later he took out money from my bank account to print them. Then another time my bank account was completely closed and I had to open a new one. No one informed me it would be closed before it was and when I went in no one really had an answer about why it was closed. But they helped me set up a temporary account until I could get cash to open a new account. It is also really hard to find branches in IL.

I had the honor of having a big problem with them after my landlord decided to cash 3 months worth of rent checks all at once. When I had thought he had already cashed them.  First of all if you get overdrafted they will make sure any deposits that are made the day of your overdrafts come in after the withdrawals so they can charge you the 35.00 overdrafts first. You get 3 of those a day plus a negative balance fee of 35 each day you are overdrafted and it can add up very quickly. When you are trying catch up from your paycheck it ends up being about a 140.00 a day for each day you are overdrafted. If you try to fix that to catch up you have to make sure you go to a full branch and that they tell you to pay all the fees and get your account back up to positive, when in the first place all your deposits were eaten up from all the overdraft fees. They told me they can fix the account by giving me some of the fees back. I went back in and they hadn\u2019t fixed anything.  It becomes a vicious cycle and the president of the bank won't help you a bit. We get paid monthly.

I was able to use this card to get my credit up in no time. It is very easy to pay off each month, especially if you do a lot of banking online. Another nice benefit of the card, is they would email me once a month with special offers for using this card. For example, one of them was $15 off any purchase at Best Buy, or $3 off a purchase at Starbucks. Each month it was a different offer, some of them were great.

She is also still a customer. That being said, things have changed quite a bit over the last two years. They have instituted rather major fees on accounts with little notice and have closed many of my local branches. I am responsible with my money and qualified for the fee waivers. However the branches that are left for my area are in rather seedy neighborhoods, so I have to drive out of my way to go to a branch I feel safe at. Also, I was rather upset that the tellers kept pushing my young student daughter into applying for a high interest credit card. I was able to deter her when I was with her, but the one teller kept calling the house to try to sway her into accepting. I understand that they have a job to do and that they make commission, but I feel that they were deliberately pushing this high rate card because she was young and more likely to screw up.

The Cash+ Card allows you to choose two categories each quarter that you will receive 5% cash back on, and one category where you receive 2% cash back on. There are only three categories for the 2% cash back; gas stations, grocery stores, and drug stores. I already have a Discover Card that allows me to receive 5% cash back on gas for this quarter so I chose to have grocery stores be my 2% category. There are twelve 5% cash back categories to choose from including items such as hotels, airlines, stores, and restaurants. The card also offers insurance on rental cars and luggage insurance for free. To date there are only two things that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like about the US Bank Cash+ Card, the first item being the website.

I called the 1 800 number to report a fraudulent charge on my account and the person I talked to said that they would refund the money to me the next business day.

On Monday I did see on my account that they refunded the money back, but 2 weeks later I received a bill in the mail stating that I now had an overdraft charge because of that fee. So I called the 1 800 number and explained everything to them, and they apologized for my inconvenience and told me they would fix it and I would not receive another bill from them.  About a week later I received another bill and this time instead of calling this number back, I went to one of the branches to talk to someone in person about this. The teller was very nice and he told me that he would get this all straightened out and also told me I would not receive another bill. So I waited another week to see if I would get another bill and sure enough I got another one.  I went back to this branch and this time I talked to a different teller about the problem and at this point I was so frustrated that I told him to close out this account. So he told me that it's not a problem and said it would take up to 72 hours to be closed.I waited until the time was up and went back to check my account online to see if the account was closed. When I looked on my online account though I could see that this account was still opened and I noticed that the overdraft fee charge incurred interest which meant that I owed more money that before.To make a long story short It took me 5 months to finally get everything straightened out and a completely different branch to help me.Ever since then though I have had no problems and the customer service is great at the branch that I go to now."},{"date":"2012-07-18","name":"Amanda Green","user_id":"amanda.green.98096","verified":false,"product":"U.S. Bank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I use the US Bank platinum visa card because I bank with US Bank.

My husband and I were browsing the Target.com website, when we found a really great deal on an Xbox360. We thought about making the purchase, but I decided to check the online banking before we went ahead. On the website, I noticed a single $100.00 even charge at Target, as well as a $1.00 charge. This was under my card number. Before I could make it to the phone to call US Bank, my phone was ringing. US Bank called and asked if we were the ones making the $100.00 purchase (the customer service agent stated the card was swiped, not input, therefore we knew it wasn't us on the website). The customer service was WONDERFUL! They stopped the purchase, and sent me out a new card during the phone conversation. I received it about a week later.My other experience was just last week. I was buying a vacation for myself and my husband, and after I had already purchased one hotel room, I decided to cancel and re-book as I found one cheaper. I had canceled the first hotel room, but the refund had not yet gone through when I tried to purchase the second. On the website, I was having issues, saying that the card was being denied. I called 1800-US-BANKS (yes, their phone number IS that easy to remember!) and immediately they resolved the problem, turns out they were going to call me anyway to verify the purchase, I just beat them to it!!I love this bank for it's checking service. Every branch I've ever gone into has been a pleasant experience. The tellers are trained to tout their latest products, but they are a business, so I do understand that. My only gripe is that I tried to get a S.T.A.R.T savings account online, rather than in person at a branch, and the website denied me.

Unlike Capital One's Mastercard, which can be started with a small $49 deposit, US Bank requires $300 minimally.  US Bank does pay a small amount of interest on your deposit with them, but the goal with any of the pre-paid and secured credit cards is not to hold them for a long period of time, rather, you want to use them to rebuild your credit and establish a good reputation with the cardholder as soon as possible. US Bank excelled at keeping tabs on my account and within nine months, I was offered an unsecured Visa through them. My interest rate to start on that card was quite high, only a couple of points less than what had been the going rate on my secured card with them, but they did perform regular credit reviews as promised and that card is now one of my lowest interest cards.  Customer service has been above average, but I think I actually received more personalized  and faster service when I was carrying their secured card than I do now. Contacting customer service involves the typical listening to the robotic voice explain all of the menu choices and then pressing a series of numbers until you finally connect with a human, but once you make it that far, the representatives are quick to address any issues and are extremely polite.Regular reporting to the big three credit reporting agencies make this low-annual fee card a great deal for anyone trying to build or repair their credit record."},{"date":"2012-07-10","name":"Jen Schumaker","user_id":"jen_schumaker_52","verified":false,"product":"U.S. Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"Overall my experience with US bank has been very satisfying.

I double checked with them that there will not be any fees for inactive accounts before I left. In 2011, I started to notice monthly maintenance fees charged to my account, I panicked... since there isn't anything I could do being overseas to help that. I emailed their support and they told me they no longer provide the free checking and my account had to be over certain amount to waive that fee. I explained to them my situation, being overseas and wasn't aware this change had taken place, I had received no letters or emails regarding this. So there I was, being overseas, slowing watching my account drained bit by bit every month. I don't blame them for getting rid of the free checking, given the economy that the time, but charging to existing customers without notice is what made me pretty unhappy with them.

I admit I'm being a bit old fashioned about it and am going straight to the banks to ask about policies and rates and such rather than researching everything on the internet.  And while I do try my best to dress well and be polite, I admit I can be a jerk and a fool at times.  But I don't think that excuses the rude behavior I experienced when I went into my local branch of this bank.  It wasn't busy when I went in so I got in the teller line to find out who I should talk to about a loan.  The teller asked \"are you too stupid to read?\" and pointed at a sign that said \"loan officers\" or something like that.  I was kind of shaken by this and rather than thank her I said, \"okay,\" and went over.  The person there sat and read a magazine at me and shushed me when I tried to ask a question about loans.  When I asked to speak with a manager, he got up, went over to someone behind a glass partition and spoke to them.  I could see them point and look at me for a few minutes as they spoke and then the guy came back.  I was told, \"no, the manager will not speak with you,\" so I left.  I don't know if they were having a bad day or if I did something to precipitate it but it was the strangest experience I ever had going into a bank.  They're supposed to be a good bank and a few of my friends have had great luck dealing with them so maybe I'll try working with another branch before I give up on them entirely.

But the best part about the account for me was the $50 incentive they offer after you reach $1000, and then another $50 after maintaining $1000 for a full year. a $100 return on a $1000 was a great opportunity (especially considering savings account rates are only 0.20 on average, if that!). I had to open a checking as well in order to qualify for this deal but it was worth it. The checking account has been easy and simple to maintain (no fees).

If you fly to Mexico regularly and always fly Aero Mexico, then the Aero Mexico Credit Card could be helpful in lowering costs, depending on what exactly it offers.  As far as rewards go, the AeroMexico Credit Card gives you, 15,000 miles after your first purchase, 2,000 bonus miles and a free companion ticket each year you renew your account membership, two miles on each dollar spent on Aero Mexico, a 10% discount on Aero Mexico airfare, and 1 mile per $1 spent on everything else.  The miles per $1 spent aspects of the Air Mexico Credit Card\u2019s rewards offerings aren\u2019t very special, but the bonus miles, free companion tickets, and 10% discounts certainly are\u2026if you\u2019re a loyal Air Mexico passenger.  If you aren\u2019t, what good will these perks be.  When it comes to rates, the Air Mexico Credit Card does not offer any low introductory rates on purchases or balance transfers, though this is to be expected from a card with attractive rewards.  Such a card could have a fairly substantial annual fee to offset the lucrative rewards, but this isn\u2019t the case with the Aero Mexico Card, as it does not have an annual fee in the first year and only charges $45 each subsequent year.  10% off airfare and free tickets are obviously worth $0-45, so I would certainly be interested in the Aero Mexico Rewards Card if a brand-loyal frequent Mexican Airlines flyer.  If not, I\u2019d look for alternatives.  This is the same advice I\u2019d give to anyone considering an airline-specific credit card because people who do not fly only with the airline affiliated with their card won\u2019t see as much benefit as often, nor will they be able to mitigate the threat of rewards devaluation.  So, let\u2019s talk options to the AeroMexico Rewards Credit Card.  If you want travel rewards, I\u2019d go with either the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, which gives you $625 in airfare\/hotel nights as an initial bonus, or the Capital One Venture Card, which basically offers 2% cash back across all purchases.  If you don\u2019t travel all that often, I\u2019d go for cash back rewards, either via the Capital One Cash Rewards Card (1.5% across all purchases) or the Blue Cash Everyday from American Express (3% at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else).  If you want low rates, there\u2019s both a Chase Slate Card and a Discover More Card offering 0% on purchases and transfers for 15 months along with no balance transfer fee.  Any of these cards would be better than the Aero Mexico Credit Card for the average consumer."},{"date":"2012-02-08","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"U.S. Bank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"The \u201cCache\u201d in Cache Credit Card refers to the store by that name, but what you have to figure out in deciding whether to apply for the Cache Card is whether it\u2019ll lead to you garnering a cache, i.e. a treasure trove, a store of valuables.  Let\u2019s start with what the Cache Credit Card offers.  In return for the good or excellent credit it takes to get it, the Cache Card gives you 5% off all purchases at Cache or Cache Luxe stores and on cache.com, 5 points per $1 spent at Cache and Cache Luxe stores, 1 point per $1 spent everywhere else, and 1,000 bonus points after your first purchase.  It doesn\u2019t offer 0% intro rates on either purchases or balance transfers.  It\u2019s therefore pretty clear that the Cache Credit Card is a good option for people who spend a fair amount every month at Cache stores.  Everyone else wouldn\u2019t get enough value from the card to warrant application.  Before anyone applies though, its important to note that the Cache Credit Card is a No Preset Spending Limit (NPSL) card, which means that you won\u2019t ever know what your spending limit is and might incur credit score damage at no fault of your own as a result of the way issuers report credit utilization for these cards to the credit bureau.  If you were on the fence about whether or not to get the Cache Credit Card, this might be the deciding factor.In terms of alternatives, the Blue Cash Everyday Card is a good option because it gives you 3% cash back at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores and 1% on everything else.  The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card also gives you a $500 bonus for spending $3,000 during the first three months."},{"date":"2012-02-06","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"U.S. Bank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":2,"review":"If you\u2019re in the construction industry or love to do home projects, an Ace Credit Card could be for you.  Before we get ahead of ourselves though, you shouldn\u2019t just apply for an Ace Card because you sometimes shop at Ace or have been meaning to tackle this or that.  You should get it if Ace purchases represent one of your biggest expenses.  Why?  Because the Ace Credit Card\u2019s rewards are primarily Ace-oriented and you want to have rewards credit cards that allow you to maximize your perks, both in terms of overall value and how often you benefit.  See, the Ace Credit Card offers 3 points per $1 spent at Ace stores (plus an extra 2 points per $1 if you spend above $12,000 in a year), 2 points per dollar spent on gas and groceries, and 1 point per $1 on everything else.  You also get a $10 bonus for opening your Ace Credit Card.  Unfortunately, you can only redeem Ace Credit Card points for Ace store credit and points are redeemable at a rate of only 0.2% (12,500 points = $25 at an Ace store).  Given that these rewards are uncompetitive as well as limiting in terms of redemption and since you also don\u2019t get a 0% introductory rate on either purchases or transfers with the Ace Card, it\u2019s hard to imagine a scenario where the ACE Credit Card is a good choice).Therefore you need some alternatives.  If you want a card that gives you a good cash back rate across all purchases, the Capital One Cash Card is a good offer.  If you want a card offering extra on gas and groceries, the Blue Cash Everyday Card is not only more rewarding than the Ace Credit Card, but it\u2019s also more straightforward.

Any credit card can be a charity credit card both in the sense that you can simply donate your rewards personally or sign up for one of the charity giving programs that most credit card companies now offer.  That means the Children\u2019s Wish Foundation Cash Rewards Card is not the only option people looking to give to this particular cause have at their disposal and it must therefore be held to a higher standard.  This card offers a $10 statement credit after your first purchase and \u201c1% cash back each year on everyday purchases like groceries, gasoline and movie tickets.\u201d  You also get 0% on both purchases and balance transfers for 6 months, which I guess you could use to keep more of your money in the bank for longer and donate the interest revenue to charity.  Still, the Children\u2019s Wish Foundation Cash Rewards Credit Card is obviously not that good.  It doesn\u2019t even appear that these rewards are automatically donated to the Children\u2019s Wish Foundation; perhaps U.S. Bank, the cards issuer, simply gives a portion of the profits derived from the card to the charity.  Either way, there are better ways to give back.For example, you could open a card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred and donate the $500 initial bonus you get.  You could also get a card like the Capital One Chase Credit Card, which gives you 1.5% cash back across all purchases, and donate on an ongoing basis.  Capital One also lets you customize the entire front side of your card so you could put a Children\u2019s Wish Foundation picture on the front and get the same branding as the Children\u2019s Wish Foundation Credit Card.

Like their names, these cards are all pretty similar.  They require good or excellent credit for approval, are issued by U.S. Bank, offer 0% on both purchases and balance transfers for 6 months and don\u2019t have annual fees.  With the exception of the Baylor Alumni Association Visa\u00ae Platinum Credit Card, they all offer some rewards as well.  So how's a Baylor alum supposed to choose?  Obviously rule out the ugly duckling card that doesn\u2019t have rewards, but what then?  Unfortunately, I would also discount the card listed on this page.  If you didn\u2019t know, VISA SIGNATURE CARDS HAVE NO PRESET SPENDING LIMIT.  I put that in all caps because many people think that NPSL cards don\u2019t have limits.  That isn\u2019t a reason to get the Baylor Visa Signature card though, it\u2019s a reason to avoid it.  This card will have a limit, it will just change on a monthly basis and U.S. Bank will not clue you in on what it is.  You aren\u2019t alone though, because they won\u2019t tell the credit bureaus either.  By opening the Baylor Alumni Association Visa Signature credit card you then resign yourself to never knowing if you have enough available credit to make a big purchase and the potential for credit score damage.  In terms of the remaining two cards, I guess the 1% cash back and $10 intial bonuses that the Baylor Cash Rewards card provides is preferable to the 1 pt.\/$1 spent offered by the Select Rewards Visa, but neither will give you as much value as the best rewards cards on the market.  I\u2019d therefore suggest opening the Capital One Cash Card, throwing a Baylor Bears-themed picture on there for free, and calling it a day."}]
