But that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing, considering neither card offers much.  The Sears Store Card gives you an initial choice between a $10 gift certificate and deferred-interest promotional financing (http:\/\/wallethub.com\/edu\/deferred-interest-study\/25707\/ ). Beyond that, you get access to discounts in specific spending categories and a well-above-average regular APR.   The best thing about the Sears Store Card is its lack of an annual fee. This enables you to invest in your credit standing without putting any money on the table. But the Sears Card is far from the only vehicle for low-cost credit improvement. With that in mind, it\u2019s probably best to take a pass.  Nevertheless, if you\u2019d like to learn more, you can find a full breakdown of this offer in our complete Sears Credit Card Review: https:\/\/wallethub.com\/edu\/sears-credit-card-review\/25964\/."},{"date":"2020-05-04","name":"WalletHub","user_id":"WalletHub","verified":false,"product":null,"review_comment":true,"stars":4,"review":"Citibank Personal Loan ReviewCitibank personal loans are a good option for people with good or excellent credit. They offer competitive APRs, at 7.99% to 23.99%, and up to $50,000 in funding. These loans are only available to people with an existing Citibank account (checking, savings, money market or CD). In addition, personal loans from Citi are a bit harder to get than average, as the minimum credit score required is reportedly 680, compared to 660 for many competing lenders. Citibank has a bit of a stained reputation, with an F rating from the BBB and over 500 complaints about their personal loans with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. You should take time to look through some user reviews and weigh them against Citi\u2019s good personal loan terms before applying.Citibank Personal Loan Review Highlights: \u2022\tCitibank personal loan rates: 7.99% to 23.99%\u2022\tOrigination fee: $0\u2022\tLate fee: $25 \u2022\tLoan sizes: $2,000 to $50,000. \u2022\tRepayment periods: 12 to 60 months. \u2022\tCredit score requirement: 680, reportedly\u2022\tMinimum income requirement: $10,500 \u2022\tOther requirements: Have a SSN, ITIN or passport and be at least 18 years old.

The day of the party, we used it twice in the neighborhood to pick up food.  When the time came to pay for the party at a venue in the same neighborhood as the other two charges, they declined it.  We were NOWHERE near our credit limit.  It's humiliating enough to be declined.  Then to make matters worse, they don't authorize immediately by text or e-mail.  They use snail mail.  In addition, their Reps are very difficult to understand.  The venue agreed to wait until after the weekend to try again.  In the meantime, we actually had a call with Citi, another credit card company and us to verify the activity.  After 45 minutes on this conference call, Citi REFUSED to verify bc the name on the other card was Steven, not Steve, despite having our address and social.  Needless to say, we had to put it on a credit card with a much higher interest rate.  In addition, our credit rating was impacted.  We tried to get Citi to make a balance transfer with no fees bc of all the problems they caused and they again REFUSED.  It's unacceptable and unethical business practice. They should be shut down.

Someone stole my Walmart account access information and bought an electronic $100 google gift card and a rug. As soon as the order was placed Walmart sent me an email confirmation, Immediately I called walmart to void the order, I was told that the rug can be canceled but the Electronic gift card can not. I would have to deal with my credit card fraud department to get credit for the $100 fraudulent charge. Walmart provided Sears Mastercard with proof indicating that the purchase was made from a cell phone app that was initiated from California while I live in New Jersey. After three months of numerous calls and arguments with Sears Mastercard support, they tell me on the phone that I am not responsible for the $100 charge then they send me a letter saying that after they investigated they found that I am responsible. Finally I decided to pay the $100 and cancel all my Mastercards and Visa cards and replace with American Express. One more advice to everyone, don't leave any credit card info saved on any online account. Most will force you to save your credit card to make the purchase, after you complete your purchase go back and remove the credit card from their system."},{"date":"2021-08-25","name":"George Kalil","user_id":"georgekalil3","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"Citicard customer service is non-existent after 6PM.

All of this while you have been told publicly that your card was declined, and you have to either stand there and make everyone else wait for you while telling the world your security information on the phone, OR simply use a different card, IF you were wise enough to have a back up handy. No matter what I do, this continues to happen. Last night was the LAST TIME as it happened in a high-end restaurant with business associates.

I ordered it online and was given a one-week delivery date. I received confirmation from the Home Depot and multiple updates concerning my order which was scheduled for August 6. I have been using an ice chest for the week and was definitely excited about receiving my new fridge. Well the day prior to my delivery, I receive a notification that my order will arrive tomorrow, Friday Aug 6. At this point, we\u2019ve moved everything out of the way to make a clear path for the delivery driver\/installer only to receive an email on Friday saying there may be a problem with your delivery please call this number. So I called the number, was placed on hold multiple times only to find out they cannot locate my refrigerator. I\u2019m then told, sorry about that, we can order you a replacement BUT It won\u2019t arrive until August 14. WTH? I was furious but stayed professional with the representative and simply asked her to please Cancel my order and that I couldn\u2019t wait that long especially with an 8yr old and a Toddler in my home. I was assured by the rep that I would receive an immediate credit within 3 business days. WELL after a week and NO credit back to my account, I called and asked why my credit hadn\u2019t posted to my account, I was then placed on hold for exactly 20 minutes\u2026.it felt like an eternity, and then I was transferred without knowing why and they disconnected my call\u2026I called back and another rep looked up my account, placed me on hold twice and then proceeded to tell me it takes 14 business days to receive credit. I was stunned\u2026I couldn\u2019t believe what she was saying to me. I asked to speak with a supervisor\/manager and she told me it may take up to 72 hours to receive a call back.

Prior to that I had to swipe both my Shell card and Fuel Rewards card separately. So, in addition to offering a larger rebate, this was also a much simpler process. Boy, was I wrong. I immediately noticed I wasn't getting a lower price when I pumped my gas. So, I called Shell (I think) and was told the credits on that card would appear on my billing statement, which is handled by Citibank. Wrong. No billing credit. I called Shell and they bounced me to Citibank, saying it was their problem. Citi bounced me back to Shell, etc. After nine months of follow the bouncing ball, I finally spoke with a Citi rep who said it was indeed Citi that needed to activate (link) the Fuel Rewards to the card and he would take care of it immediately. On my next bill, I finally received a bill credit, but as it turns out, it was only for the prior months. It still was not linked to my card. Fast forward to last Friday, when I again received my bill with no credits. Spent a total of 3 hours on one phone call, getting transferred back and forth between Citi and Shell. Finally got a supervisor at Citi who said he understood the problem and would definitely be able to take care of it for me. Before I could say BOO, a lady answered with, Hi, I'm Monica. How may I help you?\" After questioning, turns out she was with FuelRewards, which is a third corporation, completely separate from either Citi or Shell. They are Excentus Corporation out of Texas. She tried to bounce me back to Citi, saying it was all their fault. I protested and informed her to coordinate between Excentus Corporation, Citi and Shell to get the problem solved between them, as I had already spent tens and tens of hours to no avail. She agreed and said I would get either an email or phone call in the coming days to let me know it had been fixed. I supplied her with ALL my account info. Two hours later, I began receiving emails from Excentus Corporation (apparently via Salesforce???) wanting me to supply the info that I had already given, Each time I did, I would receive another automated email from Excentus Corporation with a new trouble ticket number. With each new ticket number, I would then, a couple of hours later, get an email from another rep requesting the same info I had provided to all the previous reps. When I reply, I get another automated email with a new case number and a new rep. Yes, that was exhausting! After a year, I am canceling my accounts with all 3 corps and will be filing Federal and State complaints for deceptive billing practices and buying my gas at Chevron. Unless you want to waste a year and end up with nothing but aggravation, don't bother with this SCAM."},{"date":"2021-07-27","name":"mkteet6","user_id":"mkteet6","verified":true,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"always near interstates so good for travel use. billing horrible, interest rate criminal, does not accept bank direct pay. see all above comments for customer service or should i say lack of customer service."},{"date":"2021-07-26","name":"Clark Kent","user_id":"cmccarthy259","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"I was told when I signed up I would have $200 to apply for seats on the flight I was booking that day and would pay for with my new AAdvantage card.

It was not available in store so I tried to order it online. An offer of 20% off my purchase by opening a Macy's card popped up. I have an 820 credit score so I figured why not. I did the application and got a message to call them with additional information. I did, and had to deal with Citibank, big mistake. I've dealt with Citibank before. They are the most incompetent organization I have ever dealt with. You have to speak with foreigners in other countries. You can't understand them and they don't know what they are doing. Big companies like Macy's cut costs by outsourcing jobs that should be going to Americans and instead pay people in other countries, pitiful. They asked some basic questions and said I was approved. Then the chaos started. I tried placing my order for the diamond ring and kept being switched back and forth between credit and the online purchasing departments with long holding periods each time. Every time I was switched I spoke with a different person who gave me a different story. I finally got so frustrated I just told them to cancel\/close the charge account. The next day I received an email from a credit monitoring site that reported my score dropped because of the Macy's inquiry. The whole thing was a nightmare.

We called because it was still getting declined and they told me that I had a hold on my account, they had tried to contact me today and didn't get a hold of me and therefore marked my account as fraudulent.  (I never received a phone call or an email by the way).  The only way I could get the hold lifted was wait 7 to 10 business days for a letter to arrive.  I asked to close my account then and they wouldn't even let me do that.  I understand the need to protect my identity but this seems like a drastic step especially since my identification was verified.  I even get not allowing me to purchase anything but not being able to close the account seems like a stretch.  Let alone every person I talked to made me feel like I was a criminal for trying to open an account under my own name and kept saying they had proof of how this card was being used in a suspicious manner but couldn't tell me what the proof was.

Here is the message that I sent to CitiBank, I'll update my review with their response. I honestly don't know where else to reach out. I opened a secured credit card with CitiBank earlier this year with the maximum deposit. I pay my balance whenever there is a balance. Now almost every time I use my card, citi flags it as fraud and blocks my card. Every time I call in, which has been more times than is reasonably acceptable, the agent verifies my identity and unlocks the card. Each time, they have to use a different method for verifying my identity, so anyone with any sense would realize that eventually we would run out of different verification options. Well yesterday I attempted to use my card, which of course was declined and blocked. Upon calling Citi, they told me they would be MAILING me a letter that I would need to confirm and that there was no option to unlock the card over the phone. As you can imagine, this is insane and concerning. What if I was traveling or had an emergency? It's so obvious that these transactions are mine, because I'm paying the bill multiple times per month. If these were fraudulent charges, why would I pay the bill? ON TOP of all this, my payments have ALWAYS processed and cleared with no problems. I made a $1500 payment a few weeks ago and that payment was held for almost 2 weeks, even AFTER the funds had come out of my checking account. None of this makes any sense. I'm seriously considering closing my account and posting some negative reviews of Citi, but I'm rebuilding my credit and don't want to close the account within this first year. My major concern is, what will we do next time, after verifying the item sent to me by mail? Every time I speak to an agent, they tell me the fraud verification should clear up and prevent any future fraud flags, but it keeps happening. Surely someone can do something about this... there is absolutely no reason to continue to block my charges, I've verified my identity in every way possible, Im making full and on time payments out of the checking account in my name. I've waited weeks for payment credits that were already deducted from my checking account on top of the fact that I put a $2500 security deposit down to open my account. Why am I being treated this way? I hope someone can help get this craziness to stop. I do think it's important that potential future customers are aware of these practices BEFORE they do business with Citi Bank and ill be posting this complaint on public review boards, hopefully you'll have a response that is satisfactory to show future customers that you care about treating them well.

Which is insane.   Why?   My FICO scores range from 835-850.   Yearly earnings vary from $230,000 - $260,000 per year.     We have NO DEBT.   I have a number of credit cards but they are paid off every month.  No loans,  just paid off our million dollar home.    Assets in the range of millions.Then, after I complained, they opened the credit card with a limit of $2000.   LOL!   Really????!!!      The same day I applied to Chase Sapphire and got a very large limit and a few months later with Fidelity Signature Visa and got an even larger limit.    (Just sayin'.)But it gets better!     Even though I have had a Citi Double Cash card for OVER A DECADE and have a flawless record with that, they refused to apply my payments to the Premier card for WEEKS.   That's right - they take the money from my bank and refuse to allow me to use the credit line even though they have the money for weeks.    It is the same payment account being used to pay the Citi Double Cash card, by the way.This is a form of theft, is it not?    Think about it.   They take the money from my bank account and, in effect, create a forced loan from me to them because they don't make the money available to me to use, but they HAVE IT.   Somewhere, right?    Free interest for them using my funds in a forced loan every time I make a payment and wait for weeks for it to be applied to my credit line.They are treating me like a brand new customer they have never met before - after over 10 years with them as a customer they act like this 5 month old account is suspect and I am engaging in criminal activity that needs close monitoring.

For average credit this was a great card, however, along with the higher credit line also includes the highest APR out of all my cards. The APR is variable, and I hope it will move lower, although I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s changed in the several years that I\u2019ve had it. It\u2019s still a nice card to have mainly in the case of an emergency where additional funds are needed, but there are many superior options that provide better benefits with a lower APR for an every day type of card.

The agreement was for us to keep the account in good standing and at the end of the two year period, we would be issued a regular credit card account and our initial deposit would be returned to us (Keep in mind we didn't earn ANY interest on the deposit)  The deposit amount was for $2000.  WE kept up our end of the agreement.  Not only did we pay on time but we paid WELL over the minimum amount due.  We called in on April 9th and requested our deposit to be returned and was told by the CSR that we would have our money back within 30 days.  We waited the 30 days and when we didn't receive our funds, again called Citibank and was NOW being told that they needed to keep our money for ANOTHER 12 months for review.  On top of that, they tried to say they sent us a letter out in March detailing this.  If that was the case, why did the CSR tell us we were going to get our money back within 30 days in APRIL?  Long story short, WE chose Citibank because we BELIEVED that they were a company of INTEGRITY.  You're only as good as your word you put on paper.  I wouldn't have a problem with them holding on to the deposit if we had missed some payments or even if we paid the bare minimum each month but that's not the case.  I routinely spin at least $500 per month on the card and make a monthly payment of at least $500 per month.  Please tell me how you would need to review an account that has more than a 12 month history of these type of payments?  I'm beyond disappointed  and saddened by this.

Every single credit card I've ever owned (that's alot) has always applied payments to the oldest promo balance before any others. This card applies payments to promo balances last, so if you carry a regular balance and a promo balance you have to pay the regular balance in full first. I spent time on hold to speak with customer service so they could apply my payment to specifically to the promo balance. They said they would. Next statement, nope. Payment was applied to new balance leaving the promo balance about to expire, which would leave me hit with the entire deferred finance charges.

Most of the standard credit cards with no annual fee will give you a maximum of 3% for gas purchases. Shell is the only one giving actual discount on the price per gallon at the pump. So I decided to do some quick maths to see what was the best... #Savings with 3% back: S(1) = (Volume pumped) x (price per gallon) x 0.03 #Savings Shell with 10cts per gallon: S(2) = (Volume pumped) x 0.10 Now it is just a matter of comparing both. For example, if we pump 1 gal of gas, then we have: #S(1) = (price per gallon) x 0.03 or plot (y=0.03x) #S(2) = 0.10 or plot (y=0.1) #intersection of both slopes give the price per gallon for which, if located under then the Shell card is better, if located above then the 3% Credit Card is better So basically S(2) > S(1) if the price per gallon = 3.33 $\/gal. In other words, if the price per gallon is lower than 3.33 $\/gal, then you will save more with the Shell credit card than a 3% credit card. However, if the gas price is way above 3.33 $\/gal, then a 3% credit card will make you save more... Note that a 3% cash back on gas is very rare for a free credit card, usually it is 1% or 2%. Also note that Shell has a few partnerships such as Tmobile, Dunkin, Giant and others big brands that give you extra cents to save per gallon pumped... So let's think you have 20cts\/gal off with Shell when pumping. Then a 3% cash back credit card would generate more savings if gas price is 6.67$\/gal or higher! And a 2% cash back credit card would generate more savings if gas price is 10$\/gal or higher. ;)"},{"date":"2021-05-19","name":"j3rrysosa","user_id":"j3rrysosa","verified":true,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":2,"review":"Paid my account on time every time and it still takes 15 plus days for my payment to clear even after they confirm that it has been received.

HOWEVER, read ALL of the fine print if you sign up!  Apparently, there was some included \"debt protection\" service tacked on, which I never noticed until fairly recently (along with a lot of other people according to consumer reviews, so I think they changed something in their billing statements.)  This debt protection cost is based on your balance - 99 cents for every $100 on your card.  You can absolutely cancel this service, but they won't even entertain the idea that you didn't actually sign up for this.

It all started with a citi rewards card. I rarely used the card but ended up making a purchase totaling approximately 40% of the limit. Initially the plan was to pay it in full when the bill came due but then covid happened so I chose to make payments instead. Soon after I received an email stating that my credit limit had been decreased. They lowered it to just above the balance for absolutely no reason. I had never missed a payment, good income, and excellent credit. And, by them doing this it lowered my credit score because I now had a card with a balance of roughly 97% of the limit. The next problem was with my BestBuy visa, provided by Citi. I had used the card and paid it off multiple times and had not used it since the last time I paid it off therefore I thought the card had a zero balance. Today I received an email stating that this cards credit limit had been decreased. Unbeknownst to me I was being charged $2.50\/mo for something and had accumulated a past due balance of about $10. Because of this Citi dropped my limit to $350. Again, good income, excellent credit, never missed a payment until now because I didn\u2019t even know I was being charged.

She disputed the transaction which was then removed from her statement.  After a period of time and some \u201cinvestigation\u201d, Citibank decided to reverse their decision and put the charge back on her card.  To be clear, my mother-in-law has always paid her bill on time and has never claimed fraud in the past.  Upon my own furthered research, I discovered that the company who made the fraudulent charge does not even exist.  Had their fraud department actually done their job they would have discovered the same thing.  In an attempt to remedy the situation I spent over two hours on two separate occasions speaking with no less than 10 different representatives, most of whom were with the collections department trying to collect the $300.  Long story short, I got absolutely nowhere with them trying to resolve this issue, and was treated very poorly in the process.  I paid the $300 fraudulent charge and an additional $75 in late fees which she was harassed over daily for weeks just to get them off of her back.  She promptly cancelled her card, and I did the same.  I certainly hope the $300 they received from a fraudulent charge makes up for the thousands of dollars of lost business in years to come.

That way the entire conversation is reviewable later if need be, and your understanding of the conversation is limited only from your reading comprehension skills. And I can honestly say that my credit score was not even close to 700 when I applied and was approved. However, at the time, the only credit cards I owned, was from Capital One, and a Discover card. I received a letter from Citibank saying I was pre-approved; went to the website filled in all requested information, entered the pre-approval code they sent me, and was immediately approved. I received my card about a week later. It's been great ever since. I pay off any purchase immediately. As soon as it posts, and allows me to pay it, it's paid. I do the same with all my cards.

Today I'm looking to do a balance transfer and if you don't have a physical card you're SOL to figure out your account number, even though you provide your SSN and everything else in a public store location, that has cameras and exposed to people everywhere. Also if you put a block on the account to restrict any other authorized users from making changes or using the card, you can't just request a card to have the account number, you actually have to reactivate it, therefore making yourself actually vulnerable in a messy divorce situation. Who's Best Buy looking out for?  I don't understand that their \"safeguarded way\" is to put a physical card out there with the account number on it if it's so vulnerable and not able to be discussed over the phone with the account holder. Seems rather antiquated...and to top it off now I have to wait 7-10 business days, no option to expedite the card in order to even begin the balance transfer process.

After using the card and making my payments on time for 3 months, they increased my limit to $10,000. Wonderful feeling to know you have a plan if something goes wrong. I continued to pay my card on time and they increased my limit to $17,000. Then life happened and I needed legal fees covered for a divorce. (Not mine) I paid the lawyer retainer and their fees which came to a little over $13,000. Still never missing a payment, I sent in a $4,000 payment. They dropped my limit down to $10,000 and increased my interest rate because when they dropped my credit limit, it dropped my credit score, severely. It made it look like I maxed out a card, which I didn't when it was $17,000.  Now I have just paid off the remaining $10,000 because I was paying $300 a month and $200 of that was going to interest. I checked this morning to make sure the payment went through and they AGAIN dropped my limit to $400 something and charged me $150 for purchases I haven't made. So, I am being punished for paying off my card and previously punished for making a big payment. Since Citi dropped my card credit limit the first time I have been struggling to get this card paid down. My credit score is now poor with a mere 620 score. I am so disappointed with the Citi card.

When I asked why, CitiBank requested proof that the product was not delivered. A couple weeks later I presented TWO (2) letters from the package courier, DHL, one of which was from the Executive of Customer Care proving in writing that my product WAS NEVER DELIVERED. After presenting my evidence proving 100% in my favor, CitiBank still ruled that I had to pay $982.30. Why? Because the merchant doesn't feel like giving a refund....are you kidding me? This is not a joke. CitiBank Disputes Team said because the merchant doesn't feel like giving me a refund for a product never delivered, I'm still expected to pay $982.30 and if I don't they threatened negative repercussions. How can CitiBank call themselves an honorable and trustworthy company when they use these tactics to get money from people?

The seller turned out to be in China (although that's not always a bad thing), and this wasn't apparent from their website. When I finally received their product (which I suspect took so long because they didn't manufacture it or buy it from the manufacturer until I bought it), it was the wrong size (smaller).A few months later, after wrangling with the seller online (to no avail) and with PayPal (lots of promises of help, but ultimately no help in getting a refund), I contacted Citicard ... and received lots of help, good, professional help. I submitted the requested documentation online (easy with their online systems), was issued a provisional refund after review, and waited for the seller to respond to them. The seller essentially refused the return shipment, then lied and said they hadn't received it. Citicard told me my claim was denied and the refund cancelled, but offered me a chance to submit additional supporting documentation regarding the return shipment, which I did. After a review of the additional documentation, they reinstated the provisional refund, contacted the seller and must have said, essentially, \"How do you explain this?\" One month later, the provisional refund became permanent.When no one else will help you and you're about to see over $600 go down the drain, having Citicard on your side is a lifesaver.

I had a business line of credit for a while, linked to a checking account. The only purpose of that LOC was to transfer funds to the checking account when I was short of money there, and conversely, transfer the funds back into LOC from the checking account. Therefore, note that the LOC account number was never exposed to anyone, I never wrote checks on that account or did any kinds of transfers except to my own, linked checking account. Recently I noticed a large ACH debit, almost $5,000 on that LOC account. I started calling the Citibank phone number. They kept transferring me farther and farther; in the process the call was dropped twice; I kept redialing and repeating the merry-go-round. Eventually someone from the correct department answered, apparently outsourced to India; The quality of call was so low, I could barely understand what they were saying, but, of course, I did not dare hang up after the calling ordeal. Anyway, the fraud information was collected, and the investigation started its course. I did not trust them fully, thus I went to my local branch to speak to the representative, to make certain the investigation indeed commenced. After waiting for an hour, I was seen by a rep, He did confirm that the investigation has been opened, but could not address my concerns regarding the fear that something like that may be repeated, after all, someone has the requisites of the account. I also expressed an opinion that this fraud must have been an inside job by a bank employee, as nobody had access to the account number. He promised to email me the results of his search. He never did. I followed up with him \u2013 no response. Third email: he responded that the investigation is in progress, that\u2019s all. I reminded him that the purpose of my visit to him was to find a solution to prevent further fraud and either change the account number or place a block for ACH or other withdrawals. No response. In 2-3 weeks, I receive a letter that that they refuse to refund the fraudulent charge and suggest I contact the recipient bank. Absolutely ridiculous! If fact, we did. It was Citizens bank. They were quick to respond and very polite, were eager to investigate, but needed the name of the person, who initiated the ACH withdrawal. Citibank had the name; they did not share it with me. This is my story. Citibank does not stand behind their business customers; they do not have fraud protection tools, like Chase, when you are able to setup what kind of transactions you elect to allow or disallow and the amount; they do not offer even alert system (or at least, I was not offered that). And again, I an convinced, this was an inside job. I will keep trying and hope will get to the bottom of it.

The customer service representative claimed the charges would be removed. The card was canceled and a new one was issued.The following month Citibank bought the accounts for that particular store card. One month after that we received a statement claiming the payment was late and fees were assessed. We then contacted Citibank customer service and explained this to them. We were transferred countless times and a few long holds, we were told that department was now closed for the day. Three days later, when that department was open we called and again explained the situation. We were then told we had to contact the prior issuing bank. We contacted that bank and were told since they no longer controlled the account we had to contact Citibank. Yet another call to Citibank, more hold times, and transfers,  we got the Citibank representative to confirm with the former bank that the charges were fraudulent. That person assured us that everything was taken care of. The following month we received another bill, with additional late fees. This was infuriating beyond belief. The process was repeated again. The following month, it was the same story. At this point there are now three late payments on my wife's credit report without merit. We have continued to spend countless hours on the phone attempting to get Citibank to rectify this situation since April. It's now September and my wife's credit has now prevented us from getting the full amount of a home improvement loan that we applied for, as well as prevented us from being able to refinance our home loan. Had we known that less than $100 would have cost us this much time, and frustration we would have just paid for the fraud and closed the account.

Prior to that, Back in September of 2019, they notified me I was 4 months delinquent when I had never even received a bill in the mail. I was informed my bills were \u201cpaperless\u201d & going to an email address I never heard of or even signed up for the card under. I requested an actual bill in the mail from that point on, paid my $289.00 delinquent account via phone with another credit card was told everything was good. My house sitter tried to use my card, with my permission, to handle a home emergency today, September 10, 2020, & it was declined. In contacting the company, it was only today I learned they closed my account a YEAR ago. I never received any notification, although the Supervisor said it was mailed to me. Turns out, they never updated my new address when I moved despite giving it to them via phone in September 2019. So I\u2019m sure my \u201cclosed account\u201d notice was returned to sender given the post office only forwards mail for 6 months. I was told I could \u201creapply\u201d & I told Citibank I have 37 credit cards in good standing & I wouldn\u2019t do business with them again if they were the only credit card company available. Supervisor said, Thanks for calling\u201d & hung up. Really?!  Obviously Citibank doesn\u2019t do business on the up & up, the mistakes made in my case were their fault & they reported this to my credit report. It\u2019s THE ONLY THING on my report DESPITE the fact I paid the delinquent balance in full. Shame on Costco for using Citibank for their credit card provider. They should find a reputable company & dump Citibank. DO NOT APPLY FOR A CITIBANK CARD!  YOU WILL BE SORRY. There are way better credit card companies, with better interest rates you can get.

Read this first because from my experience their credit card policies are cut throat and offensive. Put simply I had a 700 credit score when I applied for their card and after 11 months of repeatedly maxing out my 3000 dollar limit and paying it off within the same month, they cancelled my card without warning and caused my credit score to drop almost 50 points. I never made a late payment and used my card for several large purchases. Well I had some fraud on a different credit card that caused my credit score to drop just below 600. I disputed the fraud and got that situation resolved as fast as the appeals process allows. But within that time Best buy decided to cancel my card without warning or consideration using the credit reporting bureaus inaccurate information during the time that i was correcting the fraud and credit score drop caused by that fraud. Thus causing my score to drop another 50 points. I called their customer service and they responded with the typical, \"we are sorry sir its an automated system and there is nothing we can do. But you can reapply for a new card\". This was absolutely ridiculous because due to them dropping my card i was now under the required minimum credit score to qualify. I explained that the information they had received was incorrect and didn`t reflect my true credit reputation and score. I explained that the fraud of another card caused the initial drop in my credit score and that it had been recently appealed and corrected. I explained everything and they did nothing to help or rectify the error. They simply said ,\" awe that`s too bad, try again\".

Interest charged even when you pay your balance off every month. Excessive wait times on the phone. Unhelpful representatives in the chat feature. Terrible customer service, especially during the pandemic. It took well over 2 months for the refund from a cancelled flight to be applied to my account and in the mean time I had 3 fees (two interest charges and one late fee) even though I had paid my balance in full each month. After waiting on the phone for 2 hours and being transferred around like crazy they finally fixed their mistake and refunded the interest and fees. I finally thought I was done with the mess and logged on a few weeks later only to notice that I had a \"standard interest charge\" applied to my account. When I asked about it they told me that if you ever have a month where you carry a balance you are then charged interest on all purchases from the date they are made, not from the end of the statement date like usual. **Basically, the clock starts ticking on your interest the second you make a purchase even if you intend to pay your balance in full at the end of the month.** They said that this type of charging does not go away until you have not carried a balance for over 60 days. Of course I never actually had carried a balance so this charge was arbitrary. It took another hour for me to get this charge refunded and I suspect I will have to deal with the same problem next month even though they swear they fixed it for good this time.

She needed a checking account so I opened one with Citibank for her online. I provided her land line, my cell phone, and my email address. She\u2019s never used a computer and wanted me to take care of all the online banking. We would have opened a joint account but that requires you to go into a branch in person, something neither of us was willing to do during the massive Coronavirus outbreak here in LA since I\u2019m a Type I diabetic and she\u2019s old as dirt. \tWe never got a card or pin in the mail but didn\u2019t think we really needed it since we had an account number and she got a checkbook. She transferred every penny she has into this account. A few days after this she went to stay with her sister in another town because of her failing health. Immediately we started running into problems with them wanting to call her house and give a pin every time we tried to do anything. They wouldn\u2019t use my cell phone or my email or verify us any other way and didn\u2019t care that she wasn\u2019t home. We had to resort to arranging a time her neighbor could go into her apartment and answer the phone to text me a code whenever we wanted to send $20. \tI spent many hours with Customer Service during this time explaining why this was a problem, but everyone told me a different thing. One person told me this verification business would go on for two weeks, another told me two months, another told me it was indefinite. One told me that it would stop once I activated the card and, when I said I already had, told me I had to get a new card and activate it again. We ordered a new card, waited for it to arrive activated it, but nothing changed. Another CSR told me we needed a pin and then this would stop, but we requested a pin be sent out three separate times and for some reason never got a single one. I finally got one to set up a pin with me on the phone, but again nothing changed. At one point a CSR told me she had opened a case for me and that the \u201chigher ups\u201d would be in touch to help, but the next guy told me that\u2019s not even something they do. My grandmother and I were hung up on more times than I can recall, and not just when we were being nasty. It\u2019s like they\u2019re all trained to just hang up on you when they get tired of talking to you.\tAt their suggestion, I also went through a massive amount of hassle to get external accounts verified with trial deposits so we could make online transfers, but they blocked every single one. Later they told me it\u2019s because the external accounts were not hers, which of course was the point of having external accounts linked in the first place. They also suggested I added \u2018payees\u201d and then I would be able to make wire transfers for free, but after going through that whole maddening process I learned that there\u2019s a $25 fee every time you want to do that. \tAs bad as all this was, it got much worse last week when I got an email out of the blue saying that the User ID had been blocked and I had to call to unblock it. When I called they told me they couldn\u2019t help us unless we had someone at her house answer the phone to get the stupid code, so we had to wait days until her neighbor could go back and await their call. That day we set up a time when I could take an hour off work and the neighbor could too and called them up, just to be told that they couldn\u2019t call with a code after all. This time they told me we had to go back to the house and call from the land line. I explained that we were out of town and couldn\u2019t go back just to use that phone, but every single employee I talked to just told me they wouldn\u2019t do anything else. During this time, we couldn\u2019t pay bills, couldn\u2019t pay employees, and were racking up late charges and overdraft fees all over because Citibank wouldn\u2019t let us use our money. \tWe had no choice but to pack up and go back to grandma\u2019s house just to use the phone. This is all very difficult for her since she can barely move and we don\u2019t have a car, but they would give us no other options so we packed up all her things and her wheelchair and got a very expensive Uber ride. When we got back yesterday and tried calling I was told they had to verify by calling me back on that number. So I hung up and waited twenty minutes. I called again and explained that no one had called me back just to be told that since it was \u201cin the works\u201d with that guy no one else could help me. After an hour I really had to get back to work so I called yet again and went through all the rigmarole of the system and being on hold for twenty minutes and being transferred back and forth for the third time, finally to end up being told by one of the managers that they can\u2019t verify us over the phone at all anymore and that grandma has to go into a bank with two forms of ID. \tShe does not have two forms of ID. She does not have a car. She\u2019s 97 and it\u2019s painful for her to get to the bathroom, let alone into a bank. She\u2019s in the group with the absolute highest risk of dying of Covid (I\u2019m in the second) and we\u2019re in the highest-risk cities in the US. I told this to so many CSR\u2019s, explaining that they\u2019re literally asking us to risk our lives before they\u2019ll give us access to the account, and were repeatedly hung up on. Not to mention that many of their branches are closed because of the pandemic and we\u2019ll have to go miles away. We don\u2019t know what else to do, so tomorrow I have to take yet another day off of work, get another extremely expensive Uber ride, sit in LA traffic for an hour, go inside a bank and risk our lives, probably just to be told that she needs a passport or something before they\u2019ll give her her money. \tI honestly feel like they\u2019re putting her in an early grave. I\u2019ve never seen her so stressed out and I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019m having a mild heart attack for about two weeks straight. She was actually crying on the phone with them yesterday and they hung up on her. I tried to make this as succinct as possible and, long though it is, it doesn\u2019t even go into all the problems we\u2019ve had just trying to use a simple checking account."},{"date":"2020-07-27","name":"James Travis","user_id":"jimzway001","verified":false,"product":null,"review_comment":true,"stars":1,"review":"Sh**tybank pulls some shitty moves.

I became POA of my grandparents back in February 2020. I drafted a general Durable Power of Attorney document and submitted to the bank for review. I just needed to be added to their account for money management purposes and to be able to make decisions for them. It was never told to me that Citibank had their own POA document, so a process that shouldn't take long--took a while to set up for no reason other than that the rep didn't really have a firm grasp on the bank's processes. I understand that there are holes in communication sometimes, so I overlooked it. I've visited a Citibank physical location at least 5 times to get access to my grandparent's account in a single month. Why? Because they eventually determined that it was the Durable Power of Attorney document that I had submitted--wasn't THEIR document. Again, it was NOT explained to me that I needed to use their document. They took my document and told me that it would be fine. Eventually, I was added to my grandparent's account as a user, and Citibank explained to me that I could do everything that they [my grandparents] can do, but that I couldn't be both a user on the account AND POA. Okay, fine. I called today asking to place a daily limit on my grandmother's debit card because of spending concerns. I'd bet that you can guess what they told me... \"We have to speak to your grandmother...\". My grandmother has dementia--she cannot make such a decision--and THAT is the reason why I got access to their account! Citibank has demonstrated to me that they don't care about aged adults suffering with memory care issues. They certainly don't really care to help me to do the right thing for my grandparents. A terrible experience, for sure. I can never recommend this bank to anyone. If I could stop my grandparent's federal pensions and Social Security benefits from being directly deposited into Citibank...I would.

Once I finally completed the process, when I logged in, the profile for the account only had my information and not my husbands. Called customer service as we wanted to be sure it was a joint account and accessible before depositing money. The woman I spoke to said that there was no way to set up a joint account online and that the account was only in my name and they would have to mail a form to our address to add my husband (didn\u2019t make sense since I entered all my husbands SS # etc in the online set up process and specifically applied for a joint account. She then further said I needed to send them a copy of a utility bill to confirm my address and do anything further with the account.This too made zero sense to me and for something that is supposed to be online and simple didn\u2019t sit well with us. So we went with a different online bank. Account was easily set up in less than 5 minutes. Funny thing is that today we both received debit cards in the mail with both our names listed as the account holder.

For whatever reason, this card gets compromised at least once a year (with no markedly different usage than any other) and getting a new card is at best slow (takes weeks in the mail) and twice I never received the new one so I had to get another sent. DO NOT rely on this being your main physical card as you may be without one for a month at a time or longer. I currently don't have an activated physical card because I never received the last one and just don't even bother using this account anymore.Citi's web and mobile experience is similarly frustrating. I can only log into the website if I disable a couple of privacy extensions, I'm on there now and privacy badger (EFF) blocks11 trackers and my ad-blocker blocks 43 (and counting). Trying to login with these enabled results in an endless circle of entering credentials and being brought back to the login form. For a reference point, the amex login page (which actually lets me login) has 2 trackers blocked and 4 ads blocked. The mobile app is constantly down, and despite giving repeated access to use Face ID, it simply does not work. Even when bringing up my password manager (1password), which works seamlessly with my other financial type apps, requires a search and inconsistent autofill behavior. It may have improved now, but the process to add to Apple Wallet required much more authentication than other accounts, ironic as this one is the least secure I've ever had.How they initially set credit limits make no sense, when I applied a couple years back I had a 16k Amex limit, Citi auto-approved 1k. I asked for an increase which got denied. A few months later they auto-increased my limit to 4500. Its been auto-increased to something like 6500 today.The 0% APR length at the time was the best out there (and appears like it still might be). This is the only thing the card has going for, subsequent APR is average to above average, so if you do go for this card be prepared and consider only using it for your 0% months and ignoring it \/ minimal use later. I would not at all recommend as your daily driver especially as there are so many options out there that simply work where this card doesn't."},{"date":"2020-06-02","name":"Daniel callarman","user_id":"sacred1earth","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"Very rigid company when it comes to late fees.

I then told her to connect me with someone to cancel my card. She never connected me to anyone. She canceled my card and hung up on me at the same time. I have a credit score of 815."},{"date":"2020-05-16","name":"shawna_28","user_id":"shawna_28","verified":true,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"been a great card with rewards for american airlines.  if you travel with AA this is an excellent card to have with many other bonuses including lounge access."},{"date":"2020-05-16","name":"Amber","user_id":"amberc_94","verified":true,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I love my card it just has too if high of interest.

When they approved my card I was so inspired that I went ahead and began to add others to my open credit diversity. Well the IMPOSSIBLE happened! I can't believe it.... 2 secured credit cards and 1 credit builder loan later I've gone from a fico score of 485 to a 645.

First time being late since I opened the account 7 years ago. Payment portal, which is the absolute worst of any card, advised me my payment amount would be double since I was late, but also that my next payment would not be due until 02\/25\/20. That made sense. On 01\/26\/20, I began being hounded by Home Depot that payment was past due and they were demanding another double payment! Four months worth of payments in less than one month!!!! I went through several escalations of my complaint up to Mr. G. Stevens, VP of Citibank. They absolutely refused to investigate their faulty billing system. I have filed complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the BBB. The CFPB is investigating. The response I received from Home Depot through the BBB was that my issue is with Citibank so they consider the \"Case Closed\" but they look forward to providing me with my home improvement needs! Good luck if you are unfortunate enough to open an account with either of these unscrupulous businesses. I now drive by Home Depot on my way to Lowe's.

It happened to me twice that a charge settled on the due date, after I had already gone into the app and paid the account balance in full, which resulted in interest charges. They expect you to check your account until midnight on the due date to ensure no other charge posts, which makes no sense and is a lot of work. I am tired of calling their customer service only to be told \u201cno\u201d every time and never reaching a solution for a problem at hand. Furthermore, their protection against fraudulent charges is \u201c0\u201d. They always take third party\u2019s side when you are disputing a charge. This ended up costing me approximately $1300 over the course of the years. I have over $60,000 of revolving credit with Chase and now do business exclusively with them. Their customer service is responsive, prompt, effective and Chase team operates with a great sense of urgency and genuine care.

I applied for the card online and was automatically approved. I made an online purchase on the same date I was approved for the card. The first order was cancelled, not sure why. I repurchased the item and later received notification that the payment could not be processed and the payment information needed to be updated. I called Best Buy\u2019s credit card department and was unable to get through the automated system, they repeatedly asked me for my ss# which I entered numerous times. After giving up on that I called regular Best Buy customer service and after waiting 20 mins to be connected to a representative was hung up on. The second time I called back I was transferred twice before being connected to the correct department. I was asked for my phone # which I provided only to be told that the # could not be verified.... this is the same phone # on my Best Buy account and the same # that I used when applying for the card. I was told that my phone number needs to be verified by an outside so that they can further assist me with my account. I explained to the representative that it doesn\u2019t make sense that my identity needs to be verified AFTER me already being approved for a line of credit, especially because the same information used to open the card is now being provided to them. I asked to speak to a supervisor so they could better explain to me what verification needs to be done, the supervisor wasn\u2019t any help either. Just told me if I didn't receive a call within 24 hours they were unable to verify my phone # and I would have to wait 7-10 days for instructions in the mail... ALL OF THIS FOR A CARD I WAS ALREADY APPROVED FOR AND NOW AM UNABLE TO USE. I was also told I cannot cancel the card as you guessed it they cannot verify my identity. This experience has been a mess and I will be cancelling the card as soon as I am able to.

Best Buy Citi Bank is the worst I have ever had. Took advantage of it only because Best Buy salesman pushed it because of no interest on my 2000.00 television purchase that came with 12 months no interest with a $4300.00 credit limit.. Ok fine, took it and paid the balance off in 90 days anyway. Now when I use it to make other large purchases and pay the new balance off before the billing cycle to avoid interest accruing my available credit will be lowered significantly below my credit limit. The last time this happened I had a zero balance, $43000.00 credit limit and only had  $234.00 available credit. Yes, I said $234.00 available credit with zero balance. I though that it was an error in the system so I attempted to make a purchase in the $350.00 range and it was declined. Contacted customer service several times to ask what the heck and received numerous generic form replies with no answer to my question. After 3 emails suddenly my available credit jumped to $1300.00 of $4300.00 still having a zero balance. The available credit on this card will change irregardless of you having a zero balance. Mine has moved anywhere from $234.00 to $3700.00 all while having a zero balance. They will not offer any explanation as to why. Ridiculous to have a $4300.00 credit limit and only have $234.00 available credit with zero balance and no explanation. They obviously do not like for you to make large purchases and pay them off prior to the due date to avoid interest. I have still not received an explanation for this.

Hence, I had to open a new checking account, effectively just changing my checking account number in Citibank\u2019s records. I had automatic payments for the total balance set up to pay Citibank monthly from my wife's checking account, so valid payments were being made monthly from her checking account, despite what was happening with my checking account, for an amount that we determined to be her portion, usually around half to two thirds of the bill. I usually made payment for my portion manually from my checking account before the due date of the Citibank account, so that the remaining balance of the bill (her portion) was paid in full from my wife\u2019s account. However, the one payment that I had made just prior to experiencing the fraud on my checking account was returned because the account was closed before the payment went through. Even though I phoned Citibank to explain, they told me that they couldn't stop the payment because it was already \u201cin process\u201d. That one payment was presented to my bank three times and returned three times for \u201cinsufficient funds\u201d because the account was actually \u201clocked\u201d rather than \u201cclosed\u201d in order to continue receiving automatic deposits until they could be redirected to my new account. Meanwhile, I entered a new payment for the same amount from my new account number. Unfortunately, I erred because I apparently incorrectly entered my new account number (it WAS a new account number after all, it was 4 digits longer than my old one and I was trying to memorize it) and that payment also was returned but as \"account unknown\". Additionally, before there was time for this first payment I made from my new account to be returned \u201caccount unknown\u201d, I made a second payment from my \"unknown account\" for my portion of the bill for the next month, which also was ultimately returned \u201caccount unknown\u201d. Meanwhile, another payment for my wife\u2019s portion was automatically and successfully taken from my wife's account. So, even though our Citibank account was NEVER late, NEVER underpaid (always WAY more than the \u201cminimum amount due\u201d), and usually was paid monthly in the thousands of dollars from my wife\u2019s account, I received notices of LATE PAYMENT because of the issues with my account, and hence, Citibank closed our account. Realize that we usually paid somewhere close to three thousand dollars total each month for over a year before this happened, and still over twelve or thirteen hundred dollars each month for the two months that this went on, but Citibank still closed our account. AND, apparently they closed it in such a manner that it could not be re-opened. WOW! That happened, I believe, automatically by default because of the programming that detected returned payments and despite not being late or underpaid and without ever having a person review the account before closure.

I was in the store had my license, had them verify my phone, email, social so they could pull me up, they gave me the green light to make the purchase yet when I tried again, I was still declined. I had well over the credit to make the purchase, I had everything verified, all someone had to do was push the unlock button and I could make my purchase. No one was helpful. I asked for a supervisor and I they told me they couldn't do anything anyways. I was treated poorly and wasn't treated like a person.

Without this downloaded information I can not balance my books.    OFX files have been around since the mid 1990's.  It is a well known and established file format.  It has strict rules about how the information is to be formatted.  But those rules have not changed in years.   Since Citibank has been successfully producing these files for years, you think they would know how to test and quality control changes to their web site.    I Google the phrase \"OFX File Analyzer\",   The first enter was for a program from Microsoft with such a file.  The latest version was released to the public in 2006.  That gives you an idea of how stable this file format is.    Downloaded and installed.  Ran it against the files from Citibank.   In under a half hour I found the TWO errors they had their files.   I can make manual changes to the files to get me back in business.

The airport lounge is not valuable to me, as I fly Delta and the lounges offered with this card are rarely convenient in Delta hubs.

Finally, the accounts were opened and accessible online and I inititated a transfer of funds.  While the funds were being transferred, the savings account was changed to Closed online but the Checking was active.  When I called, they said I didn't receive a pin or debit card because the accounts weren't approved because they needed additional documentation of my address.  I explained the address documentation had been sent in a month previously and I had already received the pin and debit card and the accounts were open and accessible three days earlier so obviously that was incorrect information. They could not resolve it and only a \"supervisor\" who had little information could be accessed by phone.  I closed the accounts as I have zero confidence in Citi bank at this point.

That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say for the card. Other than the zero percent interest, I never got perks from it. It charged me $2 a month when you don\u2019t use it. I was aware of the charge when I got the card, but it\u2019s still kind of annoying. My biggest issue is when I tried to pay the thing off. I called and made a payment over the phone and received a confirmation number for paying off the card. In addition, I got a statement 3 days later showing a $0 balance with $0 due. With the confirmation number and the balance email, I assumed I was done with the card. To preface the next part, I will take some blame for not following my account closer, but in my defense did not get another email until 37 days later saying I owed $40 on top of the amount I thought I had paid off. Granted, I had not followed my bank account close enough, and I can\u2019t see where it was ever charged or refunded now, but I NEVER got an email saying the payment didn\u2019t go through or that I had a statement sometime in the 37 days that I owed money. I ended up paying it off today, but there were $40 worth of interest charges building up and added to my original payoff amount. The account supervisor did take off one of the interest charges but did not take off the other.

Every single time I pay down my balance by a few hundred dollars at a time (just paid $450 last week), they lower my limit. My limit was $1,500 when I purchased the MacBook, I paid a few hundred dollars at one time to try to get it paid before the promotional period ended. My balance came down to $800. They then lowered my limit to $850! Last week I paid $450, making my balance $300, and today they lowered my limit to $350!

I was a victim of scam and reported it to their fraud department. Once they heard my voice, they did everything but helped me. It seemed like they were trying to help the person that scammed me by making sure I do not have access to the information that I asked for\/ needed in order to get my money back from the scammer. Under 2 days I was surprised that when I called to follow up, they told me that the case was closed. They said that they investigated the case and were unable to retrieve the money from the scammer because the person withdrew all of the money from their account. I asked them to send me a document in writing stating what they told me orally because a place I filed a complaint asked me to upload proof of what my bank said because the scammer was giving contradictory information. I called CitiBusiness Fraud department several times and was given different conflicting information every time. I spoke to several different staff eg. Janette with code TRT071 who is the manager of the fraud department, Rosa TRT012, Rosa TRT017, James who is the supervisor of the customer service department. They all gave contradictory information that does not match what the person before said, which is a proof of bias. This bank has racist employees that discriminates and preys on against African Americans. They run the bank like a prison facility when it comes to African American customers. They are not trustworthy, and I urge any African American individual\/ entrepreneur who wants to establish any account with Citibank to consider other banks. Most of their staff are Hispanic Americans, who are totally biased and have nothing but natural hatred and disrespect against African American people. When you complain about racial profiling or racial intimidation, in order to make the racial aspect disappear, they will counter you by bringing the one black staff they have on the phone, who will further intimidate you by saying they themselves are black and continue harassing you. This is the new Jim Crow. CitiBank is trying to make the claims of racial profiling go away by any means necessary.

It was not this exact card but was a CitiCard for college students with no credit history. I helped my 18 year old granddaughter apply and receive the college student card so that she could start building her credit. She had a $2000 limit when it arrived. The day that she received her card, she set up an automatic payment with a checking account so that it would be paid monthly and she would not forget to send payment. She chose to have statements mailed to her address rather than sent electronically. It is a way for her to keep a paper trail on expenditures in college. Several weeks later, she received a phone call from citi bank that her payment was past due, eventhough she had not even received a statement and she had set up AutoPay through a checking account. She explained to them that the account was set up to AutoPay but they said that did not happen and they asked if she could make a payment over the phone. She made the payment with her debit card at that time. She asked if there would be a late charge and they said no because they failed to make the auto withdrawal that had been set up and that everything should be fine going forward. The following month, she received her statement and there was a $25 late fee added to the total due. She attempted to reach them by phone with the phone number provided on the statement and reached an automated system where she could not figure out how to talk to a real person.I then tried the same number with no success at talking to a real person so I got on line and accessed their website and went to a live chat. I explained the problem and that I would like to have the late fee refunded. I also told them about the problem of not being able to talk to a real person with the number provided on the statement. They finally got back to me with another number to try. My granddaughter called the number and was connected to an automated call again. I told her to press 0 several times. She did that and finally she was able to talk to someone, She once again explained what had happened and that she would like the $25 refunded. They said that they were not able to do that because the payment was late. She again told them that AutoPay had been set up the day that she received the card in the mail and that she had not even been sent a statement so there was no way she could have known it was past due. They again said that there was nothing they could do. I was with her when she made the call, so I told her if that was the case to have them send a final statement and cancel the card, They cancelled the card.I then got on line and helped her apply for a Capital One card for students. She was aproved immediately and will probably be a customer for a very long time, if not for life, cwhile helping build her credit which was the goal from the beginning. I would not recommend CitiBank to anyone. This was not anything that my granddaughter did wrong. Late payment was all due to CitiCard's lack of organization and accountability."},{"date":"2019-12-09","name":"Jon Walker","user_id":"snoop34978","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"I charged a plane ticket on british airways, a seat upgrade on virgin and a train ticket on amtrak on the same day.

I called a third time to find out that my account was never closed, and that I\u2019d have to wait another billing cycle or two.

That increase prompted my other cards to RAISE my limit during that same period, not decrease it.

If you book a vacation (outside of your available financial means) on a rewards card, you would be able to transfer that balance over to this card for a 3% fee and no interest for 15 months. Though I don't recommend going on vacation on money you don't have, this is a good option to save yourself lots of money on interest w\/ a balance transfer. Strongly suggest this card for unexpected medical expenses.

I already had logins for the two Citicards, but Citibank required a completely new login that would cover the new savings account and the 2 credit cards, and the old logins would no longer work.  This was inconvenient at best.   I requested a replacement ATM card, and this resulted in my account being locked, and I was unable to sign in for several days until I received the new ATM card in the mail.  They didn't tell me that I could use the original PIN from the old card with the new card, so I waited in vain for a new PIN to arrive.  I also had to call in multiple times to try to get the various locks removed.   Once the locks were supposedly clear, I attempted a wire transfer from my new savings account.  About 30 minutes later, I tried to take a look at my savings account, and it was COMPLETELY GONE from both my on-line access and the mobile app.    Again, they locked my account, and blocked it from even showing on the web site.  This was extremely frustrating.  Haven't they ever heard of showing a certain amount as being on hold?    I had to go through the whole process of calling into the security department at least 3 times to get this resolved.  And even though you give the first person the answers to the security questions, every department they send you to asks the same questions.   Seriously:  If you answered the questions once, and you are still on the phone with them, can't they figure out that you're the same person?   Twice I was asked if I was responding to \"the voice mail,\" but they never sent me a voice mail.

Approved instantly no problem for a $4200 limit. Through the citi app it Has you log in to your bank account through your login credentials for you personal bank. No problems there. It populates your accounts you have through your bank, you then select which account you want to pay from.So I select said account, entered a fairly large payment, and it posts. Easy, or so I thought. From this, it rejected my payment because of a communication error through their payment system, which then populates a returned payment fee of $150. Odd. So I call, figure out it was an error where their app created which basically boiled down to they couldn\u2019t draw the checking account number correctly so over the phone I gave them the checking account number and routing, made a payment over the phone, and corrected the issue and they were going to refund the fee because it was in fact a mistake.  Now for the meat and potatoes.I go to use my card for a $1.50 soda, declined. What?! I call, citi closed the account because of a returned payment, because the app doesn\u2019t properly communicate with their payment systems, which then draw a return fee,( which never should\u2019ve happened in the first place) and now my account has been closed because of an error the citi had already admitted to. They tell me I have to submit a request to re-open it, won\u2019t be accepted because of that fee. Again, an issue that was already resolved on Citi\u2019s end. Apparently not. My account got closed because of this ridiculous error, and they won\u2019t re-open my card I\u2019ve had for 3 weeks, and I already made 3 separate payments on because the payment system is flawed. So I will never have a citi card ever again, they are unwilling to resolve this issue, and left me with nowhere to go because of their error. I have a couple cards through capital one and I have NEVER had this issue. So Citi, buh bye.

The representative said he could not give account information to anyone but the account holder\/applicant, as I stated multiple times I was not asking for info I was asking for MY bank account to be removed from someone elses account! I was then told that Citibank would not allow a deposit payment to be made from an account that was not in the account holder\/applicant's name so rest assured I would not have to worry about the payment being drafted from my bank account, so not to worry. The very next day I asked the account holder\/applicant to cancel the application or remove my account. When they called they were told that the application was processing and to far along to be cancelled (3 days??? And only 1.5 business days at that), so I checked my bank account because I just had the feeling I had been lied to about it not being able to be drafted from my account and low and behold the Citibank deposit was pending in my bank account! So I have the account holder\/application call again and explain how I was lied to and how they wanted my bank account removed somehow. They were told that Citibank does a 4 day hold on deposits so there shouldnt be any issue for my bank to stop the payment because again Citibank could do absolutely nothing (if its sitting on hold for 4 days how could that not be stopped?) So I called my bank to stop the payment, they said it would take 24 hours to be effective (4 day hold, no problems right?). Very next day I check my account and Citibank has lied AGAIN, because it was fully processed out of my account within 24 hours and although my bank will still refund it to me (takes 3 days), it completely screwed up my bank account because I had also paid another bill, thinking that the $200 wasnt going to be withdrawn, but of course because it was processed my other bill payment was rejected, I was charged an insufficient funds fee, on top of the stop payment fee, and now the account I tried to pay my bill to is going to get all messed up because they are showing it was paid but now the bank would be rejecting it... All because Citibank refused to remove my bank account from someone elses application, then lied saying it couldnt possibly be withdrawn from a different persons account and lied some more telling me it would be  a pending\/hold for 4 days before it would be taken from my bank... So 4 days from when the application was filled out and my bank account is screwed up, my bills will likely continue to get me insufficient funds fees, and their deposit payment spent 1 whole day on my pending transactions..  CITIBANK HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!! There is absolutely no way I would get any sort of account with this awful, lying, terrible company.

Only, by some \"oversight\", it is only 6 months, not 24 months when you receive it.  You will spend weeks getting this sorted out.However, they have your permission to bill the card, and therefore, will immediately bill you even when pricing isn't final, even if they don't have the total price, up or down.  Then they will tell you they will eat the price if higher, and credit you if lower.  Watch the hole, see the woodchuck.  They will tell you that the price will get sorted out in 3 days, but this took 6 weeks.  Meanwhile, the first credit card payment was due and the order hadn't even been placed yet.In short, they have you sign the contract on an ipad, conveniently failing to show you the 4-5 additional pages of fine print.Dealing with Home Depot, or their credit card, is not friendly, not accurate, not above board, and far from honest.My first online payment didn't \"take\", apparently, although it said it did.So, when I called to fix the 24 month interest free issue (stated on the contract), they refused to fix it after telling me they would because no payment had been made on the deposit for materials not yet purchased, let alone used.In short, I'm going to end up paying more, and getting less, and should have gone with a subcontractor, not affiliated with Home Depot.  They didn't follow through, cancelled multiple times, leaving weeks of lost time in between, and meanwhile, want me to pay for something that should have been installed weeks ago.

I was never notified of this account shutting off. They did not take any other action and shut it down. I asked why they didn't try emailing me with the email they send my monthly card statements to, or even a phone call to my cell listed on my account. The representative told me that they weren\u2019t even required to send a letter and they can at any time shut down an account without notification. This representative did not care.

So yes there's the possibility one can still owe interest after paying in full. However, it depends on the starting balance for the billing period. If no balance was owed, then there should be no extra interest, on the other hand, no matter how slight of a balance owed, one can get hit with this charge. Actually this was the first time I've heard of it & only because it's published on AMEX's monthly statement.

Turns out CITI was able to raise my credit limit over the phone, but I had to re-order the fridge and set-up deliver again.

You need to call back a number of times and spend hours and hours on the phone for the same issue. You try to open an account? 3 weeks later you receive a mail and find they open a wrong account for you. Or, a week later when you call to check the application status, they tell you they could not find your application. Also, the products are not competitive and the saving interest rate is extremely low. In addition, the external transfer takes 3-4 business days to complete. It takes 1 business day for other banks (even the small local banks) to complete the external transfer. Overall, Citibank entire system needs big and significant change."},{"date":"2018-09-14","name":"Alex ty","user_id":"rdtest2","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"obtained City Double Cash credit card and it  was blocked after 3-4 transactions at the first months!

The reason isn't due to American Airlines, but rather their partner, Citi. Citi is incredibly inconvenient if you are planning to travel and actually use the card internationally. Even if you notify Citi that you are travelling, even though they e-mail you acknowledging this, they will freeze your card. And they won\\'t give it back to you. Why? Because the only way those dummies know how to verify a card is via sending you a letter like we live in the 1800s. Then you have to call them and tell them the code you received in the mail. Well, what good does that do if you are abroad? None. Not to mention the fact you need to call them for this. This phone call will be incredibly expensive if you are overseas. I paid $20 for one 20 minute call. These guys don't allow the possibility of emails. This is a trash card because of its inconvenience due to Citi bank. My card has now been frozen a second time.

Gave me an insultingly low credit limit of $3000, based on incorrect TransUnion data, when I was just approved for a Discover with a $15000 limit.Even when I had the issue corrected, they told me that I'd have to apply for an increase, which would involve taking another hit on my credit score. I was told I'd have a response in 24 hours. Four days later, I called them to find out what the problem was, only to be told that I would have a response in another 24 hours.Three days after that, I called to find out what the hell was going on. First, they couldn't find a record of my application, despite me having talked to someone there a whole two days before. After 10 minutes on the phone, I was told they'd launch some useless investigation and send me a letter. In the meantime, they already posted the useless account to TransUnion, which lowered my score by about 25 points, so even if they were to get their shit together and process the limit increase now, it'd likely get denied because their own damn card pushed my score into a lower bracket.So, now I took a hit to my credit report for a credit card I have no use for.

I then call in to make another payment a little later in the month (I\\'ve been making payments via phone, from the same bank account for easily the past three years), with the call prompt customer service line telling me I have a late payment and returned check fee? I get a hold of a person, and they tell me they were unable to locate my account, and that is why my payment was returned. So I ask, why if it was returned, did Citi Cards take $600 from my bank account??? They then make some excuse about the difficulty coming from my account being a savings and not a checking account, and they don\\'t allow payment authorizations from savings accounts. So I have to have them go back into my records to realize that I\\'ve been paying by said authorizations, using the same savings account for the past three years. By my third time calling customer service, I get a supervisor that seems to know a bit more of what\\'s going on. She tells me I\\'m not the only person to be dealing with this situation, and they are trying to correct the same problem with people all over the country, due to a software system glitch that happened the day my payment was pulled from my account.Later phones calls have everyone else I talk to refusing to acknowledge this happened. Basically, they pulled money from my account, then proceeded to lose it somewhere in space (or issued it to the wrong account). It is now 4 months (almost 5 months) later, and they still refuse to return my money, or issue a credit to my account for what they have stolen. Over 17 calls later, 3 hours of my time on phone calls, 4 employee promises to call me back with updates (when not a soul has ever called me back), and my having to pay for priority shipping twice so far, to send on documents from my bank, showing the cashed check and transaction numbers for when the money was taken, etc.  They still do nothing. They had me in contact with a Payment Investigations Department for a while, that seemed to be getting some sort of headway. But the number they gave me has now been disconnected, and the department dissolved. You now have to explain your entire situation in full, every time you call and talk to yet another incompetent customer service \\\"specialist\\\" that makes empty promises just to get you off the line. One of the last times I called, they refused to even forward me to a supervisor. It\\'s ridiculous that they have stolen from me, and refuse to correct it. If a Citi Reputation Manager reads this, I will be writing similar reviews on every platform I can find until my $600 is returned and this situation is over with. If you\\'re curious, this is Samantha C. with card number ending in 8817. Look it up.If you\\'ve read this far readers, the point is - don\\'t get a card from these people.

Due to this MASSIVE error that they admitted that took up much of my personal time, I still was without money in my checking account for 2 days, had to borrow money or else would face a penalty from my bank, missed out on the opportunity I had that day, and could not pay any of my other bills nor could I use my checking account to buy essentials like food and gas. \u00a0The MAJOR predicament they put me in was only worth $25 a day to them. \u00a0While there were a couple of people who were helpful and concerned, I overall would NOT recommend this card, as unfortunately I do not feel they made up for their massive error. \u00a0It would have been a small price for this giant corporation to pay out of customer service, and because of their mistake, I was the one who paid the price. \u00a0I will certainly inform my Goodyear and anyone interested in this card of this extremely disappointing experience."},{"date":"2017-09-27","name":"Brandon Hoover","user_id":"b_r_hoover83","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"Its an ideal card all around great for people on the move and in a hurry get what you need without spending to much time its very handy to have never have to worry about running out of gas or getting a snack if its going to be a late night"},{"date":"2017-09-22","name":"lynnkroupa","user_id":"lynnkroupa","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I was in complete shock that I got approved.

I have my account set up for auto pay so I do not regularly look at it. The set up the payment amounts equally so it would pay off the promotional balance by 12 months. In December 2016, I was going thru the account and noticed I was being charged interest so I contacted customer care and they applied the promotion and credited the interest.I thought ok fine this was all taken care of but little did I know this was only the beginning of their scam! The promotional purchase expires October 2017 and I checked my account today July 2017 only to find out none of the payments from the last few months was not applied to the promotional balance and everything was being applied to my regular purchases I had made a few months earlier.I called customer service and was told I need to set up a payment allocation plan and that the payment is applied to regular purchase balance first unless I called them to allocate or set up the allocation plan. I have auto pay so I do not have to deal with this kind of stuff! I was never made aware of this and have never had to do this with any other credit cards I've used! They were able to allocate some of the recent payment but said it takes a billing cycle to update and I only have 2 months left to pay a larger balance than what I was expecting.My phone call further escalated to a manager and she proceed to tell me I've only been making my minimum payments on my master card which was why nothing was applied to the promotional balance. So I asked her what My sears MasterCard promotional beginning balance was and she stated it was $324 and proceed to tell me what I paid and said it was my fault for only paying minimum payment. She then tells me in March 2017 I paid $325. I had to stop her and asked her to explain why that amount wasn't allocated and my promo balance should've been paid off. (After speaking to her I remembered that I made the March payment assuming it would go towards the promo balance and be paid it off). She realized their error and allocated that payment to pay in full the promo balance for the MasterCard.As for my sears store card they were able to allocate the payments but what I had to go through to get this fixed was disgusting! This is definitely not an honest company and if I had not looked at my statement I would've probably been charged all the back interest on those promo balances.Now that I think back I have bought tires from them a few years back with a promo as well and was charged the back interest because the same thing probably happened and I just didn't pay close enough attention!If anyone is planning to do any promo purchases with sears make sure that's the only purchase on the card and check your statement very closely!"},{"date":"2017-07-11","name":"No Thank You","user_id":"mellymai","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"This card is great if you love getting patronized by their phone reps with \"don't worry I understand\" canned speeches followed by holding for supervisors who will tell you things that blatantly contradict what another supervisor later says, after you tried to do the thing the first supervisor said to do.

If you get one PRAY that you never have an issue with it- because it will NEVER get resolved. Neither Best Buy nor CIti care enough to do anything about it either. When Best Buy first switched to Citi they managed to somehow merge my card and my father's so my card had half of my information and half of my fathers on it. Besides being a pain, this also made it so i couldn't pay online. It took 6 months of them giving me the run around and i eventually had to get my SENIOR father to go to the local store with me and have an employee call them to verify we were each who we said we were for them to get my information correct. No sooner had that been resolved than i stated having an auto-payment that I NEVER authorized start coming out of the last account I had paid with. As I didn't know this was there (because it wasn't supposed to be) it over-drafted my account and double paid my bill for the month. I tried for 2 years to get this taken off. At one point I had almost a -$200 balance because it kept overpaying itself every month long after i stopped spending on it. I tried closing the card and they REFUSED to do so!! (even though I didnt owe them ANYTHING) I eventually had to start spending on the card again because i was just loosing my money every month.Calling the phone number got me rude people who gave me lines such as \"just deal with it\", \"everyone uses auto-pay now, that's  how it's done now\" and on more than one occasion just being hung up on.  i finally went through the chat option (because when you try to email them they tell you to go to your local Citi branch for your problem- even though its a store card and so the local branches send you to the store who also cant do anything with it because it all has to be done by citi) i finally got a girl who i believe was actually a bot program who finally managed to - not remove the auto-payment - but change it to pay $0 each month. At this point i will take anything to get away from this card.  And i really think it's anything powered by Citi that has this problem because my mother had a similar issue getting support for her costco card that is also through Citi.

Your money is unsafe with this bank, when you will have hard time and ask this bank help you they will make your situation even harder, and they will try to cheat you if they could. So don\u2019t have any deals with this bank even if it close to your house but if you already a customer leave this bank as soon as possible before you get hard time and this bank will take advantage on you! I had account in this bank more than a year and what I\u2019ve experienced. Someone took about $300 from my account in Japan without my card, so don\u2019t be impressed that this bank says that we have secure cards with cheap, the account security is so weak that hackers don\u2019t need not you, not your card for grub money from your account in this bank. And security system so stupid that it can\u2019t figure out that if I pay with this card a few hours before in Miami I can\u2019t be already in Japan. And after I report about this fraud in this bank they said that they will investigate this problem and if all OK I\u2019ll get refund within 10 business day! It sounds like this is my problem that Citibank gave my money someone in Japan! And I guess I\u2019m lucky that they didn\u2019t took all my money because it would be hard be without money within 10 business days! And they try to cheat you if they can! For example I pay nothing for use my debit card if I make at least one registered transaction, other way I have to pay $10. So I created an auto payment for my phone so I didn\u2019t worry about this. But in several month I saw that I was charged $10 as monthly payment. I contacted bank throw chat but they said this is because your money was sent later so it wasn\u2019t in my cycle period and refused refund me my money! Like this is my problem that this bank sent it later though money was available on my account and it was the auto payment, so bank sent it itself! And only after I called in bank they refund me money. And the worst thing from this bank is that if you have a problem get your money and ask Citibank to help you with this they will make you time harder. For example, I won some expensive lot and was a little short in money for pay for it but I thought, not a big problem tomorrow I will have a pay day and I have $300 available right now and $200 on next day as usual. I was need $400. So I asked bank on chat if they can give me $400 immediately after deposit my check, he said I have to ask it in bank. So next day I went to Citibank bank deposit my check and saw that now available immediately not $300 but only $100! When I asked what happened they said the bank changed its policy. I asked why? They said bank can do it when it wants and how it wants without any notification of clients. I asked help me because other way I will have to pay late fee if I will not pay now but they help me nothing. You may think it is happened sometimes. When I again had the same problem and asked bunk again help me cash my check faster they said it is federal law and they can cash my check up to 7 days! So they gave me nothing on next day and said I have to wait till Wednesday for completely cash my check, though I said I need pay my rent and I need this money as soon as possible! So my recommendation never have any deals with Citibank and if you already customer of Citibank leave it as soon as possible for you and your money safety!"},{"date":"2016-11-04","name":"zerrahwind","user_id":"zerrahwind","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"First dispute in 3 years was handled unprofessionally, almost like they didn't take my complaint seriously.

If you are 1 DAY late they charge the late fee, HOWEVER, If they charged in error it takes 2 MONTHS for the late fee to come off.3. You have to keep accurate notes every time you call customer service because they will tell you they are but the notes are NEVER found when you call back and reference a conversation you had with a rep previously.4. I have requested to have my due date changed 3 months ago in order to make sure that payments are made on time (I only get paid once a month) and the rep told me it was changed. Turns out she never changed it and I had to end up paying an extra $60+ dollars on top of my minimum balance, to include a late fee.5. They have a high interest rate and when you pay your bill only 1% of your payment goes towards your balance.This credit card has been a thorn in my side since CitiBank took over. There have been too many times (in the past 3 months) that I had to speak to a manager\/supervisor just to pay my bill. Its ridiculous! They are quick to thank you for being a loyal customer but then set you up to fail and pay more in the end. But I guess thats what credit card companies do I guess, well CitiBank at least."},{"date":"2019-03-23","name":"Sandy M","user_id":"actvbaby","verified":false,"product":null,"review_comment":true,"stars":0,"review":"The late fee applies even if you try and pay it the same day.

The late reporting on my account was unfairly reported.  NO one from home depot or CITI BANK contacted me a bout balances due or any late payments being made until I found it on my CREDIT REPORT.  This is completely unfair and UNJUSTIFIED.Your response was that my account was changed to electronic notification.  However, there was NO Email address in the system to send notification to and there was no Phone number listed on the account.Why didn't you send a letter to my home mailing address at before anything was reported as being late?  I was NEVER notified of anything being late.I have spent in the range of $50,000 - $80,000 at Home depot over the past 20 years and to be treated like this is appalling. I feel due diligence was not done by you.  I had this account open for nearly 20 years until I closed it because of this UNFAIR REPORTING.

Brooks Brothers offers rewards that are equivalent to a $20 certificate for every 2,000 points accumulated on the card.  Points are accumulated at 4 for 1 for money spent at BB and at an even 1 to 1 for purchases outside of BB.  This is not really a great reward all things considered.  You would be better off getting an Amazon rewards card, which offers tiered rewards for restaurants and gasoline as well as Amazon purchases.  The best reason to hold the BB card is to get special pricing several times a year.  The latest program provided a 25% discount on all purchases--online or in the store.  This can be a significant savings.  I would suggest getting the BB card for this reason, but seek out another alternative for better overall rewards."},{"date":"2016-03-28","name":"Ian Goodwin","user_id":"iangoodwin88","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"This is the type of card that you do not want to have.

I have several major credit cards with excellent credit lines but I make sure to pay the purchase off before that promotional period ends. I currently have a six thousand limit with Best Buy but the reason I don't like the card is because you have to either go for the rewards or the no interest period. In other words I recently purchased a major appliance for a little over 2000.00. If I wanted to earn the 10% rewards offered I would have to pay the entire bill in 30 days.

I first got it because it had an offer for 20,000 points and I was interested in taking advantage. I also had a Bank Of America Amex card, but it seemed this one would earn points quicker. And so it has proved it does. With what I spend, I have earned a lot of points that I have changed for Gift Cards. My favorite thing is that I can do so with as little as 5,000 points. I don't loose value if I have less points. For example, my Amex card would only give me 20$ for 5000 points, and 350 for 35,000. Where as this card give me a 50$ gift card for 5,000. So that is my favorite thing about the card. I also just had fraud on the card (more than 1,000 of fraudulant charges). Citi's service quickly reversed the transactions, cancelled my previous card and FedEx'd me a new set of cards. It took me about 10 mins to have all of this done, with little hassle. So I am really impressed with their service. The other feature I like is that I get my FICO score, which is very useful. Android Pay also works very well with this card.

I think they are competitive until you try to use their reward system. I signed up for the card in 2011 I think. Forgot the actual month but do remember it was 2011. If my memory serves me correctly they gave me zero percent interest rate for maybe a solid two years. It could have been 18 months but I think It was a solid two years(24 months). I have to applaud them for that one. It's hard to redeem points at their auction application at their citi easy deals rewards website. They have auctions for all kinds of items including gas gift cards. This is where I got a sour taste in my mouth from Citi. You can exchange your reward points for bids. I wanted do something with my points so I exchanged them for bids. The one positive is if you lose the auction your bids just switch back to reward points. I did several auctions and I am pretty sure I bid at the very last moment. I mean the timer was on zero when I bid and I still got outbid. This makes me think its a rigged bid system with an auto robot bidder so no one wins bids. I could be wrong but it's just the impression I get. I mean the timer said zero and it still counted a couple more bids. In certain categories they might have good deals but not really in dining gift cards. You might get 5 dollars off any amount gift card. Example $50 gift card will cost you $45. I wanted to win at auctions because it offered useful things like gas gift cards. You might get good deals on something like a sweater or maybe even travel but I have enough clothes and can't really afford to travel. Yea maybe you got a good deal on the room through Citi but there is bunch of other costs in traveling like dining and stuff.Also the auction favors long term card holders and\/or big spenders who have tons of points and they squeeze the little guys out who don't have much points on even small items like 25 dollar gas gift cards. If you only have 2000 points ( I have 5000) and wanted a 50 dollar gas card some guy (and a few of his buddies) with 50 thousand points comes along and just outbids past your points or drive it up so you have to spend half your bids. I am not spending half my points on a 20 dollar gift card but the big spenders don't care they havd a lot of points to burn.Citi scrap the auction system and give a little bit better deals in other categories and I would give higher stars. I don't really consider a reward card until they do that. If they do that I might five star them but for now it's 3 stars because the reward system should be much easier to use"},{"date":"2016-03-01","name":"Roy Seaberg III","user_id":"royseabergi","verified":false,"product":null,"review_comment":true,"stars":0,"review":"When I said you might get good deals on things like sweaters or travel those things were not part of the auctions.

On one end, it allows you to purchase something that may be a little out of your price range for 0% for 18-48mo, and on the other end, it allows you to do just that, often spending much more than you anticipated. Obtaining the card was exceptionally easy. I needed a new laptop and didn't want to charge it to my personal credit card. I told a store clerk what i needed and all of a sudden i was approved for an exceptionally high amount. I didn't complain. The one gripe i did have however, is you cant have your cake and eat it to. What i mean by that, is either you can choose their 0% financing like i did for my laptop, or you can get 5% cash back on your purchase. Honestly, I don't mind that much as I can make my money work harder for me during that 18mo time frame than what it would have gotten me had i done the cash back. Overall, as long as you don't miss a payment(read the T&C if you do), this card is an excellent payment plan."},{"date":"2015-12-29","name":"Julianne Heninger","user_id":"julianneh","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"This is a total scam.

I used it to purchase a high-end \"smart\" TV for about $600.00, and paid an extra $150.00 for a five-year guarantee, and slightly less than this  to have their \"Geek Squad\" deliver the TV, install it, connect it to the cable box, test it, etc. the next day.  After having the card in my possession for about four months, and after conducting it impeccably, I asked for and received a credit line increase from $4,000.00 to $6,000.00.  Given that I am a computer fanatic and love the latest gadgets, this card is ideally geared for my usage.  Furthermore, I recently used two $45.00 rebate certificates to pay for a 21.MHz pixel digital camera which cost about $99.99 when shipping and tax were added, so I got myself a really good digital camera for less than $10.00!The statements are clear and easy to read, and this card permits downloads into Quicken with reliability.  I use it for almost all of my purchases precisely because it brings in so much in terms of rebate certificates (I have already earned an extra $10.00 in rebate certificates since applying the two $45.00 certificates to the cost of the camera).For some time, I did not use the card other than for sporadic minor purchases.  I then decided to use it for an entire month's purchases, and received telephone calls asking me if I was indeed using the card at the various establishments where I had used it.  These calls were generated by the fraud detection specialists, and upon confirming my identity and that I was indeed the user of the card, they removed the \"warm\" card status which had apparently been applied to my account (I tried buying Quicken 2016 online and was initially declined using this card; I resubmitted my request using this card just minutes later, and received my Quicken upgrade).Furthermore, TWO fraud security analysts called me on my home and cell phones to confirm that I was the legitimate user of the card.I anticipate future travel to South Africa and to Germany, and will almost certainly use this card for all purchases, due to the cash back feature and due to the lack of a foreign exchange fee.I have always received courteous and professional help from the customer support personnel, and have never been treated rudely or disrespectfully, as so many people above state have been their experiences.This card also comes with \"Chip and signature\" technology (or perhaps \"Chip and PIN\" technology), which is coming to the United States (indeed, many stores already have the appropriate new readers).  This means that I am guaranteed that this card will work overseas when I travel to South Africa and to Germany, and I will not have to wait around while hotel concierges call Visa for authorizations due to their readers not being able to accept only magnetic stripe cards (in fact, some vendors in Europe and the UK will ONLY accept \"Chip and Pin\" technology).I do not know if I have simply been lucky, given the numerous negative references above, but I cannot overstate my satisfaction with this card.PHILIP CHANDLER"},{"date":"2015-12-02","name":"Ian Goodwin","user_id":"iangoodwin88","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"The double cash card, as advertised, is one of the only cards to offer 2% cash back on all purchases.

On every day spend, you'll actually earn more AA miles by using the SPG Amex and transferring to AA at 20:25 than you will by simply using the AA branded card itself. If you travel on AA often, however, this card has several things going for it: The sign up bonus is fantastic and the annual fee is waived. You get 10% of your redeemed miles back which can easily be worth the $95 annual fee if you're redeeming 70k+ miles a year on AA. You also get priority boarding access which is always a plus. I would never advocate for this card unless you often fly AA and will make use of the redeemed miles back & the priority boarding often enough to warrant the annual fee, but don't want to step it up to the Executive's $450 AF and get lounge access as well."},{"date":"2015-11-24","name":"JoJo Giera","user_id":"jojog","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"Horrible!

We had to send a document with photo ID to identify that it really was us.

A month later I started receiving robocalls from Citi, only on weekends or after hours, asking me to call them about my credit card during business hours.  Having no cards from Citi, my husband and I ignored them for about two weeks as a scam.  When we finally did call back to ask them to take us off their calling list, they wouldn't unless we gave them our account number.  Another red flag!  When we finally were able to have someone explain that this was in regards to a Staples card, we realized what they were referring to.  We asked for a bill to be sent to the proper address but were told we were still responsible for the full amount immediately WITH INTEREST!  Reluctantly they agreed to forgo the interest and said they were mailing me a bill.  It is now a week later, still getting automated calls, and when I called back again they said the bill is still due on the 16th whether I receive a copy of it or not.  So they can take over a week to GET me the bill but I still have to, regardless, get them payment by the 16th.  OR I can blindly give them my bank information over the phone to take care of this immediately.  And again, it was the error of the salesclerk here, nothing I did at all.  Staples manager was very helpful in obtaining the account number for me at the store this evening (something Citi won't give me over the phone at the same time they'll take my bank information mind you...) but I can't even call to check my balance because my account is in collections.  An account I don't even have access to despite asking them to mail, fax, or email anything to me proving its existence or verifying the amount I owe.  Trust me, the benefits of the 5% aren't enough in the whole world to make me keep this card.  At 27.99% interest you can take your chances at missing one payment or having a bill lost- I won't.

After 60 days since that charge posted to my account I received a call from Citibank asking when I was going to pay the $8.00 bill. After investigations on both sides and being forwarded to a Citibank manager, they agreed to remove the charge from my account. The manager insured me that a late note would not be posted to my credit report. 30 days later a letter came in the mail that Citibank reviewed the mater and since it was not a bank error they would not remove the 30 day late note on my credit report. I have never had a negative note on my credit report my whole life. I went around and around with customer service managers but they claimed there was nothing they could do. I took this up with the credit agencies showing them the last payment to the account was in May and I received this 30 day late in August, yet Citi kept claiming they reported it correctly. This negative report dropped my credit score by over 75 points and put me into a lower class of acceptance, which made my refinance of my home cost more monthly.

You have to spend 250 dollars before you even get a redeemable reward. And once you do, it's only $5. I just don't feel like that's a ton of incentive to even use it, especially if you're not going to use the card frequently. Another downfall is the interest rate.

IMHO having at least a Lowe's, Home Depot and a Sears Store card are a MUST if you rent or own a home. Major appliances do fail, many new cars come with low profile tires that are expensive to replace, etc. Great if you have credit cards with high enough credit limits to the things in \"life\" taking care off and reward points or cash back for it.  However that is not a reason to downgrade it. The card is super useful in other areas; you can use it to rent cars from Budget and buy everything for your new home; the amount of cynicism is amazing.

They charge you a high fee if your checking account dips below a certain dollar amount, which kept me in a constant state of paranoia. Third and finally, they make it impossible to close an account.

After years of not using the card, I decided to purchase my appliances with the card in store, because they were pushing 18 months 0% financing with purchase on card.  I made the minimum monthly payments and then after 17 months, I noticed that I was going to have a large fiance fee that was over $1,000 dollars that would be added to my next statement if I did not pay off the appliance in full within the next 30 days.  Luckily, I had the money to pay off the remaining $900 on my card to avoid the finance fee. It made me despise this card.

The rates are very similar to those I have seen on other cards I possess.  I do like the 0% APR for 7 months.  This can be very valuable if you purchase quite a bit of merchandise\/services.  As long as this amount charged is paid back prior to the end of the 7-month period then you have nothing to worry about.  The $35 late fee seems pretty standard as well.  Now I can safely say I do not care for the Annual fee of $95.  This is ridiculous.  I fail to see what real benefits you receive from paying a $95 fee yearly.  I mean thank you points are great an all, but in the long run you are probably going to end up with something that\u2019s worth not even 10% of what you paid to get those thank you points.  It mentions an \u201cExclusive New Phone Offer\u201d but fails to mention any more details behind this.  I mean depending on which phone they offer you and at what price this could be worth paying the $95 fee a year, but it also depends wholly on the stipulations behind the offer.  I believe the balance transfer fee is fair at 3%.  This is pretty standard throughout every credit card I have ever possessed.  Although I have had one card that had 0% balance transfer fee for the first 60 days.  That was a pretty nice intro offer.  I do not know that I would either recommend or defer away from this card.  There really is not much special about the AT&T credit card that sets it apart from others out there on the market.

I already have the card but I was halfway believing until you started talking about the reward system. I almost canceled over their reward system  but decided to keep it open since more available credit from the card looks good on credit report plus it's nice to have that emergency credit. Their point reward system is a joke however and I have even read other reviews to make sure it wasn't just me. Person after person hated it. On the gift cards you might get five dollars off any amount gift card like you pay 95 dollars for 100 dollar gift card. They also have an auction system in their reward website and it's a complete joke. I have bid at the very last second on several bids and I still got outbid. That makes they have a computer generated robo-bidder. I think one time I bid right when the timer said zero and still got outbid. Only a computer bids that fast. I bid just so I can do something with the points. Maybe you can find good deals at their Citi easy deals reward website but you have to search the site pretty good to find them. It just be easier than that to find good deals to make happy customers. Happy customers mean they will not only keep the card but more likely to use the card. I read on credit forums that people were thinking about canceling just because the reward system and I don't think I blame them. Citi needs to be reminded they have competition in the rewards category and need to clean up that system. My simplest card is the Capitol One Quicksilver. Their reward system is straightforward. It's 1 percent cash back and you can redeem anytime even a low amount like 2 dollars.i don't know if they will send you a refund (the 1 percent you earned back to you) check for that low but I have already used the 1 percent to help pay down balance. It wasn't a large amount before I redeemed either\nI have not really had a negative experience with Citi besides their reward system and since I didn't talk with a person I don't even consider it a negative experience but just frustrating.

It was easy to take their service and services for granted.But when I moved to a new state and began looking to open new accounts, there were very few Citibank branches nearby. After much delay, I finally decided to open an account at a branch that was about 15 minutes away. That as a lifetime my previous standards.But it's hard to match the range of services offered. Not only was Citibank one of the first to offer an extensive on-line presence, but they have really perfected it and complemented those services with a great smartphone app that was among the first to allow mobile deposits.Their on-line bill pay was and is still among the most extensive and easy to use.When I do need to go to the bank their customer service is excellent, whether at the teller window or with one of the officers. Further, when I have questions or issues their phone representatives are very courteous and helpful.Over the years I've had the full range of Citibank products, including credit cards, mortgages, home equity loans and even insurance (before they spun off their insurance arm). I've never had any regret or second thoughts about any of those decisions and look forward many more years with Citibank."},{"date":"2015-04-05","name":"Todd","user_id":"tjs1974","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I have a best buy credit card that I love.

So that's looking really good. Also some great security benefits here - new cards now, such as AMEX, are all starting to be made with the chip-and-pin in addition to the regular swipe stripe, which is securer and can be used more easily abroad, where they don't use the swipe cards. The fees are uncomfortably high for me, personally, but I don't travel often, so this might not be an issue for someone who'd get decent mileage out of this card. 29.99% penalty APR is freakishly high.

I've had Citibank before and dropped it because of the excessive fees, interest, and hard to get a hold of customer service. Well, Citibank must have noticed the drop in their customers and decided to do something about it. The card actually doesn't give you any penalty rate or late fee if you miss a payment (as long as you pay it within reason). It's not the best for balance transfers and the grace period is a little short at 23 days, BUT as far as their customer service and new stance on fees go, this is really a groundbreaking new idea for Citibank. With this new turn I'd recommend rolling the dice with them again if you were like me and dropped them before."},{"date":"2015-01-19","name":"Zach Vandenberg","user_id":"zach.vandenberg.92","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"The Citi Simplicity Card lives up to its name.

Its most attractive feature is the bonus points program.  After you spend $2500 in the first three months of membership, Citi offers $500 in bonus gift cards.  For every $1 spent on purchases for Airfare, hotels and travel agencies, Citi offers two Thankyou points.   In addition to this bonus, the Citi Thank You Premier Credit Card offers is one point two points per dollar spent at gas stations, supermarkets, drug stores, and commuter transportation and parking merchants and 1 point per dollar spent on everything else.  Finally you can gain three points for every dollar spent on purchases for Dining at restaurants and select Entertainment merchants while using the card.  I do a lot of travelling and get at least 3500 bonus points just from my gas expenditures.Bonus points can be redeemed for gift cards and travel rewards.  You can get free airline tickets once you accrue enough bonus points.  Thankyou points never expire so long, as you are still a cardmember and can be redeemed on-line.  You can shop at on-line retailers through the Citi Thankyou site.  This past Christmas I did a lot of shopping using my Thankyou points on Amazon.com.  It definitely took a bit of the sting out of the holidays.  Bonus points can be used for on-line bill payment through the Citi Thankyou site. On-line bill pay is another good option.  You can use your points to pay any of the bills that you normally pay by credit card.  You can also pay your credit card bill using these points which seems a lot like recycling to me.There are many travel benefits associated with the Citi Thank You Premier Card.  The card provides coverage of up to $3,000 per person, per trip if items are lost, stolen or damaged on a trip you paid for with your Citi card. If certain unforeseen events get in the way of your trip, there is travel insurance for non-refundable trip expenses, like change fees, for up to $5,000 per year provided you paid for the trip with your card.  There is Worldwide Travel Accident Insurance providing up to $500,000 in compensation. There is also travel and emergency assistance for last minute travel arrangements, travel issues, medical aid and legal issues.  Luckily I have never needed to use any of these services, but it is nice knowing that they are there if I need them.My interest rate is a manageable 13.99% and I pay $125 per year for the card.  The yearly fee does not apply to the first year and by the second year I had received benefits many times greater than the fee.  Membership also includes twenty four hour concierge service and private pass service which gives you access to tickets for special events and concerts.

There is no annual fee with this card; however, the maximum late fee is a hefty $35, and the maximum penalty APR is 29.99%. The grace period is 23 days, which is more or less the median time frame for most cards. Additionally, there is Smart Chip technology in this card, which is a special kind of payment verification. Balance Transfers are not allowed with this card.With regard to rewards, this card gives 40,000 Hilton HHonors Bonus Points after spending $1,000 within four months of your account opening, 6 HHonors Bonus Points for each $1 spent at a participating hotel within the Hilton portfolio, 3 HHonors Bonus Points for each $1 spent on purchases at supermarkets, drugstores and gas stations, and 2 HHonors Bonus Points for each $1 spent on all other purchases. The 6 points you can earn at participating hotels is the maximum number of points you can earn per purchase. You also get Visa Signature Benefits, including concierge service. The 40,000 Hilton HHonors Bonus Points earned can be redeemed for nights at certain Hampton Inn & Suites, Embassy Suites Hotels and DoubleTree by Hilton and Hilton Hotels & Resorts. It is important to note that the Hilton HHonors Bonus Points offer is not available if you have had a Citi Hilton HHonors Visa Signature Card account that was opened or closed in the past 18 months. The points you earn will never expire as long as you have qualifying HHonors activity at least once every 12 months, so they essentially do expire if you're not using your card frequently. You get complimentary \"HHonors Silver Status\" as long as you're a Citi Hilton HHonors Visa Signature cardmember, which includes benefits like a 15% bonus on HHonors Base Points earned and complimentary access to the health club or fitness center at select hotel owned and operated facilities.There is Travel & Emergency Assistance, Worldwide Car Rental Insurance, Lost Baggage Protection, $0 Liability on Unauthorized Charges, Damage & Theft Purchase Protection, Worldwide Travel Accident Insurance, EMV Chip Technology, Citi Price Rewind (they search for a lower price after you buy something, and if the same item is found at retailers\u2019 sites within 60 days, you can be refunded the price difference), and Citi with Apple Pay (you can pay in-app). With each of these services, it is necessary to read the complete details regarding who's covered, what's covered, what's not covered, and coverage amounts that will be provided upon cardmembership.

Out of all my credit options that could have done way more for me than buy electronics I keep this card. Because of the general happiness I had with best buy as a whole and the lack of problems I had with the carrier of this card before citi bank. I have had my best buy card for nearly 7 years now. And in that time yes I have made late payments but I have always paid including late fees in full. Now let's talk about the problem. I made a late payment on 9\/10 and 11\/7 in the amount of $980. Now on 12\/19 I have been notified that my once $1800 credit limit has been cut to $500 based on my \" consistant delinquent history\" and that I am 38 days delinquent for December. If my payment was due December 4th and today is the 19th then how is that possible? Also if I had split my $980 November payment in half and made a second payment on or after 11\/10 then I would have never been late for december. But because I made a lump payment 2 days before the cycle date cities bank has decided me a bad enough customer to loose me as a customer. Not only for them. But for their affiliates. Unfortunately even best buy. I will gladly pay the extra money at the local rent to own place in town (who is amazing) so that I do not have to deal with anyone who does business with citi bank.  Not to mention the type of service provided when I called in with my problem. I have worked in customer service for 16 years straight thru all venues and levels I know that there is a way to fix the problem. I also know from other interactions with citi bank that this is the norm for their company. So my opinion is anyone who values customer even a little bit will not do business with this company!

I got it only because of a rebate offer that came with opening of the card in conjunction with buying some tires. Once I received my offered rebate I paid off the card immediately as I was not going to pay any interest computed at a whopping 28.99% interest! That is highway robbery in my book and used to be illegal in most states. It still should be!  On the plus side, the card does carry some benefits for car owners who regularly shop at Goodyear stores or dealers who accept this card as you can get rebates not offered to cash buyers or those who use another credit card.

Citi seemed to have some issues offering me a card with a decent limit but after some back and forth with them I was able to push it to a higher more useful level. This allowed me to consolidate my outstanding credit card debt onto one credit card, and pay it off quickly. Also it allowed my credit score to increase since my credit utilization went down after paying off the outstanding debt. The zero percent interest allowed to me to also buy a new TV that I need to replace an older one. This was the better card to use than a Best Buy credit card or any other store credit card, because of the warranty protection that Citi offered which allowed me to double the warranty that Samsung, offered on my TV at no extra cost. I save money do that as opposed to buying a protection plan or extended warranty from the store. Also it allowed me to get price protection at the same time which meant that if the TV went cheaper during the next sixty days I could get the difference. Best Buy only offers price protection for 14 days and that's with only certain retailers. Lastly Citi offered to cover the TV in the case of theft or damage for the first ninety days which my renters insurance would cover but at a deductible that might not make it worth it. The downsides to the Citi Simplicity card is that it does seem difficult to get someone the phone that can actually do something for me. When I first applied for the card they only offered me a two thousand dollar credit limit. This seemed pretty useless to me since the capital one card I already have, has a much higher limit and it wouldn't allow me to transfer my balance. After about a week of conversations with the their customer service and reaching out to higher level customer service members, I was finally able to reach someone that could assist in raising my credit limit. It does seem like most of their customer service operations are located in India which does make it difficult to understand the person, I am talking to. The other major downside to this card I would say is the lack of a rewards program like most other credit cards offer. Bank of America offers me 1 percent on all my purchases and 2 percent on my gas and groceries which makes it the card I generally use for day to day purchases. Citi seems to be trying to hedge against rewards with their VIP program which offers exclusive concert ticket, sports tickets, and some VIP parties. This doesn't seem nearly as useful especially when you consider that you have to spend more money to use these features. At the end of the day this seems like a good card to use for large purchases but not for day to day use."},{"date":"2014-11-14","name":"Mario","user_id":"mario1398","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"Hello,This card is a Shell Mastercard, so it's accepted where Mastercard is accepted. Now right off the bat, reviewing terms and fees makes this card the worst performing card and even probably the worst performing Mastercard branded credit credit. There are no advantages to this card.No rewards, no bonuses and there's only a $0.20 rebate per gallon of case; the rebate is merely a discount. Since the cardholder would obviously be using the credit card, as the transaction comes through, $0.20 per gallon would be knocked-off (discounted.) Of course, this would only be for Shell locations because Shell wouldn't inventory every gasoline vender in the world, so it's only Shell.The regular rate is 23.99% which means for every dollar ($1.00) spent using the Shell card, Shell receives nearly $0.25. For example, spend $10.00 and Shell receives $2.50. Now $500 in qualifying purchases (means \"gas\") in 30 days and Shell rebates $0.10 per gallon. So on average, the cardholder will receive 1% for $500 spent on gas (translation: $5.00.) Careful because the billing cycle is 25 days and after the 25th day of the month, the cardholder is dinged a late fee (of course,) but here it's not clear, so assume it's tiered late fee called a max late fee.Good luck."},{"date":"2014-11-14","name":"Luke Bauserman","user_id":"luke.bauserman.1","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"This was the first credit card I got.

Some of the best include Price Rewind and Citi Private Pass. There are no caps or category restrictions. Cost:There is no annual free and a 12.99 to 22.99 percent APR that is subject to your credit rating. Even on the high end of 22.99% this is still not bad considering some of the other cards on the market. There is no over the limit fee. The max late fee is $35 and the max penalty APR is 29.99%. You can get cash advances at a rate of 25.24% APR with a cash advance fee of 5%.Benefits:There is a 23 day grace period. You can enjoy a late fee pass on your first late fee too. This is the only card that offers double cash back. You get 1% when you make your purchase and another 1% as you pay for the item. Citi also offers the Citi Private Pass that allows you to purchase tickets to concerts, VIP passes, live shows, and other entertainment. You have access to presale tickets as well. One of the best features is the Price Rewind that will search for a lower price on your purchases for up to 60 days. If a lower price is found you are refunded the difference up to $300. If you've lost your card Citi will replace it, usually within 24 hours, via the Lost Wallet Service. In addition, they provide you with emergency cash subject to your available cash advance limit. The Trip Cancellation and Interruption Protection ensures that if things get in the way of your trip, you may be reimbursed for non\u2013refundable trip expenses, like change fees, up to $1,500 per year. Other features include worldwide car rental insurance, concierge service, identity theft protection, and an extended warranty. If for some reason you need to call, you get to speak to a person instantly without having to wait. Other Pros and Cons:The card is lightweight and flexible. It is accepted nearly anywhere and uses a chip (which means you insert it rather than swipe it). On the con side, some of the online features may be a bit on the slow side or difficult to use. Also, the rewards will expire if you don't use your card for a year. You may redeem rewards once you have a minimum of $25. You can redeem cash back for checks, statement credits or gift cards.The competition:In comparison to the Capital One Quicksilver the extra .5% cash back rate is better than Capital One's 1.5% cash back rate. Capital One offers a $100 signing bonus that the Citi card does not offer. Which card is actually better would depend on how long the card is being used and how it is being used. When compared to the Fidelity Investment Rewards card the two cards are almost equal. Both offer 2% cash back and neither have a signing bonus. The Citi Double Cash card, however, has less restrictions when using the card. Also, the Fidelity cards rewards run on the American Express network, which may not always be accepted at some locations. The Citi Double Cash card is a Mastercard which is accepted nearly everywhere."},{"date":"2014-10-29","name":"Jerry Luhr","user_id":"muslimgauze","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"While Citibank will usually keep your money safe, if something goes wrong, you're all but out of luck.

Annual fee is always one of the first things that people look at when thinking about getting a new card and there's no annual fee here. For the first year there is no interest on balance transfers or purchases which is pretty common these days but still a relief to see. Once those twelve months are over, you will then pay 3% for balance transfers and a variable APR of between 13 and 23 percent. The actual rate you pay will be based on your credit score. Since this card is generally only offered to people with really good credit, chances are that your rate will be near the lower end of that range.RewardsThe way most cards are able to stand out from their competition these days is with the rewards they offer and this card is no different. You'll get a bonus of 20,000 points offered to you from the start. Those points are equal to $200 worth of rewards. However, you'll have to spend $1500 before this bonus kicks in. If you're someone who can afford to pay off your credit card right away then it's almost like you're getting $200 just handed to you.Most purchases will give you 1 point per dollar spent but using the card for entertainment or at restaurants will get you 2 points for dollar spent. If you get this card you'll probably want to use it most at restaurants to really get the most value out of this card. ConsThis card is alright, but there are a few problems I have with it. The reward program has a few flaws. Many other cards out there will offer you a better cash back rate than this one does. The fact that this card is also only truly useful at entertainment venues or restaurants is another drawback if you're someone who doesn't go out much.However, my main issue with this card is the fact that it advertises 20,000 reward points but it comes with the huge catch of how you have to spend $1,500 before that reward kicks in. $1,500 is a lot of money and many people won't be able to pay that off quickly enough. You may end up paying more in interest than the $200 you get out of the reward. It's a bit of a risky card to have but if you can afford then by all means go right ahead.VerdictIn conclusion, this is a good but not great credit card. The interest is alright (all cards have interest based on credit so your mileage may vary), you won't have to pay any yearly fee, and the rewards can add up. This might not be the best card you'll ever own but at the same time it will be far from the worst."},{"date":"2014-10-20","name":"Kristi Shafer","user_id":"krisalane","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I have to admit, I do love to spend money at BestBuy.  The credit card just makes it that much easier.  I buy what I want and pay over time and get 5% back in reward points. Come to think of it, it may make me spend more money in BestBuy...oh well. You earn 2.5 points for every $1 spent on purchases with the card. And get a $5 reward for each 250 points. Also, you get free shipping on items over $35 dollars, which can save you a lot of money when they don't have what you want in the store.  Shipping on most of these items would cost a lot of money because they are heavy items.  Customer service has always been helpful and friendly when I have contacted them.  They go out of their way to help out the customer.  I was late on my payment one time and they extended my due date and waived the late fee on my account, saving me $35.  They didn't have to, and I am sure it's not a policy for them to do that, they were just being kind in that situation.BestBuy offers a lot of sales and deals to their card holders.  They give extra percentages off and hold special ales and such just for card holders.  This can save you a lot of money, especially when they do this around Christmas time. I always enjoy seeing what special steals and deals they will bring out for us. If you are looking to get a department store type credit card, then I would recommend a BestBuy card to you, if you need to shop at BestBuy. They have lots of items worth spending money on and their customer service was very helpful to me in a time of need.

I had no choice but to buy a new one.  Annoyed at this unexpected expense, I went into Sears prepared to write a check for the purchase.  I was unexpectedly surprised by the salesperson who suggested that I apply for credit instead. I hesitated as lately I had been binge shopping and thought for sure I would not be approved.  He insisted, so I gave him my information for the application.   He input it into his computer and to my surprise I was instantly approved for a credit line of $1500. I accepted the new card and put away my checkbook, I was only slightly disappointed that there would be no reward points.What I do like about the Sears card so far is that I can pay off the purchase price of the washer without any interest rate being applied if I do so within 18 months of purchase.  The washer only cost me $599 plus tax and delivery, leaving me with some money left over to spend.  On my way home, happy with my new card and my new purchase, I thought about transferring my balance from my Citi Prestige Card and closing that account out as my Citi Prestige card has a really high $450 annual fee and carries a purchase rate of 15.24%.  I am still considering that but looking at the 5% transfer fee being charged by Sears.With the Sears card I can take advantage though of the 0% for 6-60 month intro rate on purchases to buy a matching dryer and I probably will do that once I pay off the washer.  The dryer still works well, but an upgrade might be nice.I am happy so far with the Sears credit card.

Compared to other cards, like the Chase Amazon Rewards card, the Shell card offers much better rewards. Most cards only give 5 cents back, but the Shell card gives ten, 15 and 20 depending on the amount spent in a billing cycle. This makes it much easier to use and spend rewards. If you travel a ton and use a lot of gas, this is definitely the reward credit card for you. The rewards however can only be used on gas, which compared to the Chase Amazon reward card can be used on many more items. The major downside to the Shell card is that the interest rate is sky high. The Amazon chase card has a high APV at 22 percent but the shell card somehow comes in higher at 27.99 percent.

While there isn't an annual fee, which is always a good thing, the fact that the regular rate is 28.99% makes this card a poor choice compared to others. The only reason I can see this being a good choice is if you wanted to have essentially a free loan to buy tires and then pay off over a 6 month period. There is no interest if you pay off the balance in full by the end of 6 months.

Users may be getting less than twenty cents on a regular basis. This would also take a long time to add up, in my opinion.

My husband and I are very good standing customers..pay our balance off each month and have never had an issue with our card; however, the benefits that are given for this card--well, it's deceptive.  I booked on American Airlines (using our credit card) in February 2014 for our trip in July 2014.  With AA and US Air merging, in June, they changed our airlines to US Air--not at our request but I figured since it's merging, all was good.  Needless to say, we usually get 1 free baggage checked in but we had to pay the $25 on the outbound and $25 on the return.  Usually we would pay and then get credited back.  When we returned from vacation, I called Citi about this and they sent me over to the Aadvantage Benefits Center and they could not assist me..they said their hands were tied and they could not give me the refund because it was US Air.  Again, I originally booked AA and the airlines switched our flights to US Air.  They suggested I go back to Citi as a customer and see if they would work with me.  After numerous attempts, I was given miles on AA (again, which may not guarantee anything as AA may be gone next year when we want to travel again) so I chose to close our account.  Having this card and paying $95 a year for benefits that are not good for the consumer..it's NOT worth it.  There are other cards with excellent benefits and no annual fee and they are good for the benefits they state.  I would have expected being a loyal customer, that Citi could have made this right and have provided a $50 pre-paid credit card of some sort to keep their customers.

I had enough money to pay at the time and the only reason I applied it's because the salesperson told me I wouldn't have any interest unitl next january. I wouldn't have to pay anything until next january. The next months, I realized that I was having too many credit checks failing for basic sutff, like setting up internet. I finally asked someone to pull up the information and my credit was completely damaged by an outstanding debt of 300 dollars on the goodyear credit card. I called them and they said it was their fault to not apply the \"promotion\" that made sure I wouldn't have to pay anything for a year. I paid in full, to try and re-mediate the situation but they are still processing a request to see if my name has to be removed from the credit bureau (even though they already admitted that it was their fault) and they won't compensate me for any moral damage. Conclusion, even though I paid, my name is still dirty, because I \"owed\" money to goodyear for a month. I forgot to mention, they didn't even send my credit card when I first applied, I had to call in and ask them to send it to me, which they said, one more time \"it was an error on our end\"Their system is unorganized and their mess will screw you over.

Overall, the awards may seem minimal, but they really do help reduce the price of great quality suits and men's accessories at such a great store.  Because the store offers deep discounts during sale periods, plus the benefit of cardholder shopping events, I can see the value really stacking up.  The $20 birthday discount is another great feature that not many other stores would offer on a credit card that isn't solely a store card.  As a regular loyal Brooks Brothers customer, I'll take any opportunity to save some money on their products.Another great aspect is that there is no limit to the amount of benefits on the Brooks Brothers credit card  that you can redeem like other store cards have.  This has the advantage of allowing me to use this card as my primary card and save money on purchases that I'd already be making.The only potential negative that I'd associate with this card is the interest rate.  While not exorbitantly high, it still is slightly higher than other comparable cards.

On the surface the Shell Credit Card seems ideal for those persons who drive a lot and are looking to save a few pennies at the pump, however as I study the qualifications to receive any substantial savings at the pump, a consumer must first spend at least $500 dollars in a spending cycle; ergo a monthly billing cycle. I am not saying that it's a difficult task to spend $500 dollars a month but if you micro-analyzed the offer you would find that you are spending $500 and being charged their finance charge to reach the goal of saving a small amount at the pump. By the time you'll have spent the qualifying amount, you will have practically paid full price for the gasoline anyway. Again, if your profession is one that demands you do plenty of driving then this card would be perfect for you but for the average consumer such as myself, I would choose to use my Capital One card that gives me direct cash back every time I use it; plus unlike the Shell Credit Card, a new Capital One Credit Card comes with special introductory rate for up to a year, the Shell Credit Card does not offer an introductory rate.I like the fact that the Shell company wants to help everyday consumers save cash on purchases that they are probably going to make anyway but the biggest drawback to this offer is that it flat out tells potential applicants that if you do not have close to perfect credit; then you need not apply."},{"date":"2014-03-27","name":"Robert Matye","user_id":"robert.m.matye","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I have had the Citi Diamond Preferred Card for about a year, and at best I can say that the card is okay.

The single best benefit to this card is the very generous 18 month 0% interest rate. I had to pay for several months of health insurance premiums while I was between jobs and was able to take advantage of these 18 months, which was perfect for me. However, there is a big lack of rewards, even though I am given points. I still have not figured out what these points can go toward.  Compared to other credit cards, like Chase Freedom, cash back and rewards are easy to obtain and are pretty generous with say 5% cash back in quarterly categories.  Now that I am not as stuck financially as I was previously, I do not think I will use this card because the rewards offered by other cards are much better. If you are in a jam and need a 0% interest rate card for a very generous 18 months, go for it, otherwise, if you are able to pay off your card on a timely (see monthly) basis and avoid interest charges to begin with, find a card with better rewards."},{"date":"2014-03-26","name":"Jared Boswell","user_id":"bozziusmaximus","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":2,"review":"The benefits of this are dangerous, especially for people who do not control spending well.

For example: 0% for 18 months on purchases is pretty much the way most cards are these days. Most all card companies like doing mainly to entice consumers into using the card (hopefully excessively) and waiting to see if the customer forgets (or cannot pay back it all) later when the rate goes to the much higher rate (in this case between 12% and 22% APR). What rate you get will depend on what your credit scores are like. If you have never had a Citi card, most likely you will get the 22% rate since you have \u201clittle credit history with Citi.\u201d At least that was my experience with all of them before. Citi Diamond Preferred is not a \u201cbad card\u201d to have. They did treat me decently when I did use it years ago. However I like other cards much better. For example the Discover IT Card offers a nice rebate system that pays me to shop. This has amounted to several hundreds of bucks paid to me over the years I have used that card.

There is a flat 28.99% interest rate, and they offer no interest if paid-in-full within six months on purchases of $150 or more. To put this into comparison, the Best Buy store card offers the same pay-in-full incentive, but offers a lower interest rate (25.24% - 27.99%) and has a tiered no interest incentive. Not to mention, Best Buy offers one point for every one dollar you spend. This means there is a quantifiable reason to shop in Best Buy versus Radio Shack.

Compared to the Brooks Brothers card, the rates are a little bit lower, though as aforementioned, it shouldn't be an issue unless you pay your balance off slowly. The rewards program for the Bank of America Card is a little different in that you earn varying percentages in cash back depending on what item you are purchasing (gas, groceries etc.) thus it is a little more selective than the Brooks Brothers '1 point per dollar spent wherever MasterCard is accepted'.

Annoying, but it has become a part of modern life. The AT&T Credit Card can help ease that burden a bit, if you happen to be an AT&T customer. All AT&T products, and more importantly services, are discounted by 10% for the first year when paid for with the card. After the first year, the promotion drops to 5%, but that is still a solid savings amount when you remember that it's something you'll save each month on your bill and every time you need a phone or accessory. This can also be used for non-mobile phone products and services like home phone, cable TV, and internet. Aside from the discounts, however, there isn't much to this card. Reward structure is a basic $1 for 1 point, and rates are not eye opening one way or the other. A fairly small percentage of card users will benefit from this card, but those that do will likely enjoy it very much and swear by it. Does AT&T get a lot of your money?

I personally like the 0% APR for the first 12 months. An offer that caught my eye was the 10,000 initial bonus points that will help you to begin accruing reward points quickly. However, you need to charge $650 dollars on the card, sign up for paperless statements, and redeem your 10,000 initial rewards points within the first three months in order to get your $100 gift card. You can also gain anywhere from 1 to 5 points per dollar charged to this card, but you only get 5 points per dollar when you purchase books, music, or movies. Another down side is that the cash advance rate on this card is a reasonably high rate at 25.24%. Although, my Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card is only slightly lower at 24.9%.

It also promotes $0 liability on unauthorized purchases as though this wasn't a standard, base level of expectation from a credit card. There's no rewards offered beyond Visa prepaid cards for certain purchases made at their store.

When my card was stolen, I forgot to change the account number with my bank where the bill was being paid automatically.  As a result, my payment was late.  Citi was within their rights to charge me a late fee and to raise my interest rate.

There is no annual fee, The annual interest rate on this card is 28.99% for purchases however if you spend at least 150 dollars and then pay the card off within the 1st 6 months, there will be no interest on it, and the same goes for 300 dollars or more of purchases within the year if paid off within that 12 months. What is interesting about the card is not so much the 10% discount on first purchase, but the fact that you get 15% off of all store stocked batteries so if that is something you like to buy here this card is for you. The interest rate is similar to the HSBC credit card I have, only mine has a 29% interest rate and there is an annual fee on mine of 99 dollars per year.

There is also a positive in that you can interest on whatever money you put down, and you can get a regular unsecured credit card after only 18 months. The interest rate for purchases is 18.24%, which is competitive among secured cards, and can jump up to almost 30% if paid late, which is standard among any credit card. In the end, I would recommend this secured card only if you have bad credit or no credit and need help in rebuilding it."},{"date":"2013-10-12","name":"Frank Bieniek","user_id":"Frankie6636","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Savings & CDs","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I have tremendously enjoyed using Citibank and I really like their service.

While there are many different credit cards available with petroleum companies all over the US, the only way of efficiently use the credit card offer is to use the gasoline offered by the company. If you frequently fuel up at any Sunoco, the Sunoco Credit Card is could be a great option for you. It offers 3 ThankYou points per dollar on your first and second gas purchases but turns to 10 points per dollar after the third gas purchase. This card will only be effective for the user if they make several gasoline purchases a month. You might only buy gas once or twice a month currently, but in order to get the best deal from this card, I would suggest filling a partial tank a few times early on so you can get to the 10 points\/dollar. The annual rate is variable but is offered at 16.999% according to initial documentation. No monthly fees, which is a bonus as well.

In my experience you can often buy electronics cheaper at other retailers like Target and Sears, which have store cards with APR's of around 22 and 25 respectively. I don't think the initial bonus of a 10% discount merits such a high APR on the Radio Shack card. What I think redeems this card to a large extent is the financing plan the store offers. If you spend at least $150, you have 6 months of no interest if you pay your balance in full, and if you spend $300 or more, then you have a whole year.

In general the bank has always treated me well and tried to fulfill all my needs from time to time in the most expedient way despite the highly regulated environment it operates in (which seems to be increasing over time). I have had the same experience while conducting business with Citi from abroad. Actually, in some ways their service abroad appears to be even better given the level of service of some of the local\/regional banks.The one thing that does though annoy me is the bank's traditional higher fees. I believe this to be historically true from my experience. All sorts of transactions conducted with them over the years carried high fees compared to the competition (except the online ones to be fair). Is it really necessary to still charge me $20 per month if my Checking account is below c.$2,000? Does it cost the bank that much? Not in line with their very good customer service...Also, when I enter one of their branches the pressure to buy into one of their products (irrelevant with the reason\/purpose I walked in the bank) has become extremely annoying. I understand the employees have \"orders\" to sell as much as possible, but I think their style and demeanor has become extremely aggressive!...Lighten up friends. Nobody responds favorably when he\/she feels that pressured, actually leading to the opposite effect of not wanting to come back due to fear of pressure!...All in all though I do give them good marks overall and I do recommend them doing business both in the US and definitely abroad."},{"date":"2013-10-03","name":"robert mack","user_id":"s2piro","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"The Citi Forward Card for College Students is a decent card for student that have limited credit history.

This has some ups and downs, since a certificate of deposit can be beneficial in the long term with a 1% interest rate generating some extra income on the deposit. Unfortunately, a certificate of deposit can\u2019t be accessed until the end of an interest cycle, which is typically a set amount of time like a year. If money is tight and you ever need to access the money, there could be penalties involved, which is always a tough decision to make. Aside from that, this card is a really great way to instantly get a card with a very high credit limit. If your credit score isn't very good, getting a high credit limit is generally a long and expensive process, so this is a pretty useful type of credit card to get.

If you have the funds to pay the balance off right away they offer a standard reward point scheme of 1 point per dollar spent and if you buy a lot of electronics these points can really add up quickly. The added bonus of the $5 reward at each 250 points is sometimes a nice surprise too. There is a good introductory rate of only 11% and this is for 2 years so you can use the time building up your points without worrying about high interest rates taking up all the savings.

At best this gives you an 11.99% rate after the introductory period which is nice but certainly not the best you could do."},{"date":"2013-09-12","name":"Sheryl Papageorgio","user_id":"sheryl.papageorgio","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"The Sunco Credit Card promises as much as 10% back on your gas purchases, but you really have to read the detailed to figure out how to get it.  The rewards are based on how many purchases you make in your cards billing period.  You get 3% back on your first and second fill ups, and then 10% back on every fill up after that.  If you get your gas exclusively as Sunco this could be the card for you, as even the 3% back on the initial fill ups is better than most reward credit cards.  Just keep in mind that you won't see the 10% back until the third use each month.  On the plus side though, there are no annual fees!  I would recommend this for anybody that frequently uses Sunco and is looking to get some cash back on their fuel.

I was able to buy my washing machine and could pay it off in increments. The good thing about this card is that there is no interest if paid in full within 6 months of purchasing the item. This gives me a lot of time to enjoy the purchase without worrying about the money issue. The next time I was able to purchase a new refrigerator and used the card in the same way as before. The only negative thing is that the  APR is a little high, but as long as you pay everything off in time, there is no worry.

The initial bonus offer of $100 is on par with other credit card offers, such as Chase Freedom and the American Express Blue Cash Everyday cards.

The max earn, 4, for rewards points is also higher than many of the cards I have seen. Belk and JC Penny offer only 1 point max, for example.  It also looks like you get a 20 dollar off card on your birthday and Anniversary of signing up. That is also not a bad deal.

The gift card options really are varied enough that you don\u2019t regret not getting cash back too much, but I do prefer to get cash back in my rewards.

This card is very similar to the Banana Republic Visa card that I have used in the past.  Both have the same initial 15% bonus, although Banana Republic gives the 15% to you immediately off your first purchase instead of loading the card with points.  The Banana Republic card does offer more maximum points (5) if you shop at any of the Gap family of stores.  That being said, the Brooks Brothers card potentially offers more \u201cfree money,\u201d which I like, since it rewards you with two $20 discount cards per year for your birthday and, if you are married, for your anniversary.  The reward structure is slightly different between the two cards:   you have to accumulate 2,000 points with the Brooks Brothers card to receive a $20 discount, whereas the Banana Republic card rewards you more quickly with a $10 discount after 1,000 points.  The Brooks Brothers card has a significantly better APR, varying between 14% and 24% depending on your credit worthiness, while the Banana Republic card is fixed at 23%, no matter how good your credit is.

The house I purchased was a bank owned foreclosure, needless to say it was in need of lots of TLC and minor repairs.  In addition there were no appliances in the house, so I needed a washer & dryer, refrigerator, stove, and microwave.  Home Depot being the nearest hardware store \/ lumberyard I headed there to get a start on my tasks.  Talking with the salesman in the appliance department I found out that if I opened Home Depot account I could take 10% off of my total purchases up to the limit of my account, the fact that this was on top of the 10% military discount I was receiving sold me!  I completed the application was approved for $2,500 on the spot.  Since my intended purchases totaled over $5,000 they sent me to the customer service desk to see if I could get a limit increase.  The assistance manger at customer service listen to my problem and asked if I had any other credit cards.  I said, \u201cYes American Express and Visa.\u201d  He then called the credit desk and explained he had customer approved for $2500 on a $9500 sale.  The customer was going to pay the balance on AMEX.  Was possible to increase the card limit?  They raised to $10,000 on the spot!I've never carried a balance past the six-month interest free period, so I don't have an issue with the 18% APR.  I love the fact I can pay online by check and see my account status as well.  I the five years I had this account I've never had reason to call customer service.

I deposited a check that I wrote to myself from another financial institution, as I wanted to move money between accounts without incurring unneeded wire transfer fees. After I found out it would take 7 days to clear the check, I did ask for it to be cancelled and I was going to wire the money (so it would be available on the next business day). They were not able to do that. So I did call my other financial institution from which the check came, and they immediately stopped the payment. Fast forward one week - my Citibank account balance was now reflecting a negative balance, for twice the amount I had initially planned on depositing. I spent many hours on the phone trying to understand what happened - no resolution whatsoever. I am not able to get my funds, and no one explained why I have such a huge negative balance (which will result in more fees I am sure). I do not wish to do business with a partner that makes rules on their own and would not even explain the reasoning behind them.

I was originally offered the Reserve card but after a little research decided on the Visa Signature because there is no annual fee. This card is definitely better suited for cardholders that will likely travel a lot throughout the year (more than once or twice a month). For business travelers this card is a must.

I initially consolidated two cards, and about 3 years ago, transferred the balances of notes on two motorcycles to this card at  an interest rate of 2.99% until paid off.  Essentially, I used the card as a loan, and the only interest I paid at the actual rate, which was something like 14-16%, was on the interest accrued on the balance.  I paid the last payment in January, and the total interest I paid was significantly less than I would have paid on a regular bank loan.  I don't see this type of offer any more, but have seen some that allow you to pay 0 - 1.99%  on transferred balances for up to 18  months.  I'm not sure if there's a fee for transfers, but from personal experience, if you can pay the balance off within the promo period, it's worth a relatively small fee, because you save more than enough in interest to make up for the fee."},{"date":"2013-04-05","name":"Joey Jefferson","user_id":"joey.jefferson.79","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"This is a great credit card and was my first ever credit card.

The customer service is great because they say your name as if they have known you or have spoken with you before. The one thing I didn't like was that I tried to change my credit limit but the process took a little long. But it was worth it.

However, I wanted to report some fraudulent charges on my account, which I was confident I'd be able to get them removed.

It's got a great time period for the introductory rates too which is what attracted me to it in the first place! I also love that it does not have an annual fee.

If you just use the card occasionally, the whole cash back angle is pretty insignificant. One of the good things that Citi seems to do in my experience is up the limit as long as you're using the card a lot.I got this card because I needed to buy a refrigerator and due to the price of the appliance, I got to take advantage of their introductory deal on the card where if you make a big purchase within a few months of opening the card, they give you a giant bonus. Even if you have the money on hand to make the large purchase anyway, it's worth it to use the card to buy the item because you get a hundred dollar bonus after the intro period is over.Outside of the cash-back angle, it's a pretty standard credit card. If you're looking for a backup card that might sit in your wallet, unused for years and is just for emergencies, this probably isn't the card to go for. But otherwise, seeing the cash back you get over time is fun."},{"date":"2013-02-21","name":"Mindy Overlin","user_id":"mindy.klitzmanoverlin","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"My experience with this credit card has been good over the years.

The times that I have needed to reach out to Customer Service for questions they have been very responsive in a timely manner.

I can keep track of my money responsibly. I was somewhat nervous at first, however, about switching to Mastercard as I have always had a Visa before. But I found that there is almost no difference between the two-- everyone says Visa is available in more places, but I haven't run into anywhere yet where Mastercard wasn't also accepted.

I started using it around the holidays, and have to say that it saved me a bundle of money for the holidays.  Not only does it provide free shipping ALWAYS, I earned several coupons for anything I ordered.  Not only do they accept coupons toward future purchases, but they accept more than one coupon toward an individual purchase.  That practice is nearly unheard of these days.  Also, for the coupons I didn't use, they have a wide time frame before they expire.  Not only does LLBean offer quality products, but I find their card to be a quality card.

The best part was that they waived off my annual fee for the second year. Their customer service is very professional and they really take up your queries and concerns promptly.

To my surprise, I got approved for a high limit, which enabled me to purchase more and quickly pay it off. While the interest rate was rather kind of high, it was still lower than other cards I currently have. Probably because of my high interest rate, I did have a security issue at one point in which I used the card multiple times in 1 day on high-value products. I then received a phone call from the security department of the credit card and was asked to verify the charges were really from me. After verifying the charges, my card was automatically set to go again. It was very convenient to know that they were watching out for me and making sure my card was not stolen. Other than that security incident, I have not had any other issues or troubles with this card at all. As long as you keep paying off the card, the interest rate isn't too much of a hassle to deal with."},{"date":"2013-01-11","name":"Dave","user_id":"dave15060","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I have had this card for years and I have never had a problem. I only use it for purchases of $300 *or* more so I can get 0% deferred financing. This card is great if you have some big purchases to make. But be sure to pay your balance off before the promo rate expires. Otherwise, they will hit you with ALL of the interest that built up during that time. People on this board are so upset that their payments only pay down 0% balances while any other balances accrue interest. But that is how ALL credit cards work and it is stated in the terms of use. Payments will always be applied to balances with lower interest. It is not a big secret. As for the people that opened accounts for their irresponsible children, who then maxed out the cards and defaulted... lesson learned. If your kid has terrible credit and can not open an account, then they probably should not have another credit account. Your children should be ashamed of themselves. That is why our economy is teh way it is, banks were willing to issue credit to people that could not handle it. I have never had a problem with the customer service. But I make all of my payments on time and I am in good standing with them. So why would they be rude to me? Bottom line... this card is great for people that are responsible enough to handle it.

I don't recommend the credit card though; probably one from Bank of America will be better or an American Express will have more loyalty prizes. I find that Citibank cards don\u2019t reward loyalty as much. Well, a final comment: lines were huge at this bank!

That is my best advice on this card! I have had this card now for 6 years and it is so hard not to use it and once you do it takes forever to pay off. Best Buy often has promotions offering no interest for one year but the catch is your credit card has to be at a 0 balance and all that amount must be paid off in that year otherwise it will be compounded and added onto your bill. If you have a previous balance your payment goes to that first therefore you would have to essentially pay off your entire credit card within that time frame for it to truly be interest free for a year.

This is a very good credit card for the first time credit card holder, or college student. It is accepted anywhere Visa is, so you shouldn't have any issues using it whether you are going to school within the town you grew up, or if you are going to school across the country. Also, as long as you are responsible by making payments on time this card has no interest for the first 6 months. Very handy if you need time between paychecks to get essentials such as food and gas. Speaking of getting essentials, this card also has a pretty good reward program where you can earn anywhere from 1-5 points per dollar spent depending on what you purchase! This is really good if you need to purchase books for the semester because you earn 5 points per dollar spent at bookstores. And during finals week when you don't feel like cooking and you end up going out to a restaurant or ordering takeout from restaurants, then you can also get that 5 points per dollar spent. Overall this was a very good starter card for me who was only purchasing the essentials every month and buying my books from the bookstore. It was very manageable for the payments (as long as you don't go overboard) and was very good at making sure I understood everything within the disclosures and \"fine print\".

Their standard rate was 1 point for every dollar spent, but there were some things I got 5 points for each dollar. My laptop that I bought got me 5 points for every dollar, which is a nice reward for a poor college student like I was in those days. Another good thing was is that I did not have to have a cosigner, which gave me a bit more independence and was a relief to my parents.

As a more general statement about citi, when I pay a bill they have me cleared and the money withdrawn from my bank account in two days. Other credit groups I've dealt with can take up to a week to make withdraws. This isn't the case with Citi, so your credit limit will reflect this when you make a payment in only a couple of days.

The BT transaction fee is standard (3%), no higher or lower than other cards; (2) it provides an 18-month 0 APR offer, about 6-8 months longer than the periods provided by other cards. I have been using the transferred money for other investments. Another good thing about this card is that after I paid off the balance, the 18-month 0 APR BT offer would come out again, so I could borrow the money again at a loan rate of 3% per 18 months.

Additionally you have to accumulate quite a bit of rewards before you can use them which I am particularly not fond of.However, outside of the rewards issue this is a good card with a responsive issuer that does deal with your issues if you have them and does a good job of keeping you informed of things like changes in policy or rates or fees, which is definitely a good thing."},{"date":"2012-08-15","name":"Catrice Franchette","user_id":"catricef","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I have had my Citi Diamond Preferred card for about nine months now.

After missing one (small) payment while I was abroad, the APR doubled. It was fairly absurd, especially for someone with good credit. The Citi Simplicity card had an 18 month 0 % APR balance transfer offer a few months ago, and I moved the small remainder from my Chase card and I'm now saving money every month. Furthermore, I've found that Citi has better payment tools, more branches in my area, and better electronic notifications. Overall I've had a good experience with Citi and this card, with no annual fee and lots of beneficial options, and will continue to use it in the future. The only negative aspect would be a sub-par rewards program, but I simply don't use credit enough for that to be an important factor."},{"date":"2012-08-15","name":"Garrett Lew","user_id":"garrett.lew","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"At first I had the Citi MTVU card, and then after college they upgraded me to this Forward Card.  Up until recently, this was my primary card, and I enjoyed (and still do) the many ways you can earn points.  I never held a balance on this card, so I have no experience with the APR or fees.  Being able to get 5x points per dollar on restaurants, fast food, and bookstores really accelerate point earning ability.  When going out to eat with friends, I tend to wait for everyone to pony up their cash, and then take all their cash and throw the balance on my card.  For a table of 10 at a restaurant, this could easily be a charge of $200 or more, which translates into 1,000 points for you to spend!  My only gripe is that some of the rewards are a bit \"pricey\" in the Thankyou rewards network, with the better gift cards at 6,000pts for a $50 card, or up to 14k points for a $100 prepaid visa.

There aren't very many promotions to increase the amount of miles earned over 1 mile per dollar spent, which is too bad, but if you are comparing it to the 1% cashback cards the airline miles are worth more. Customer service for the card has been very good. Citi's grace period is a bit shorter than other cards, so it does seem to come up sooner.

I was surprised finding out that after an item I had purchased dropped in price, I was refunded the difference. What card company do you know does that?

This is really nice when you absolutely need to get something on the credit card. Just like any store card though, comes very high interest rates. If you happen to not get a promotion or take too long to pay off the card you're looking at over 20% interest rates. This makes a small balance take a very long time to pay off.

If you do not pay off in time or if you miss a payment you will be charged interest on the total amount though.

You get 15 cents off per gallon, and the card even has the SpeedPass built into it, which makes it easy to pay.  I always see Mobile Gas Stations around me, so getting this card was an easy decision.  Even though you can use it elsewhere I pretty much stuck to using it primarily for gas.

The ability to deposit checks with my smart phone is something I use almost on a daily basis. The hours are great 8-6 at my local branch. Even when the banks are not open I can deposit checks through the ATM which has worked flawlessly since I started using them. ATMs are everywhere since I can use the ATM at any 7-11 convenient stores. I have had some issues with online purchasing, all a part of their customer protection program, these were easily and quickly resolved by Jeff, my account manager. The local branches themselves are some of the cleanest and modern looking banking facilities I have ever been in. The online banking with Citibank is very straight forward and easy to use. Transfers from checking to savings can be scheduled to happen automatically which is a great feature. The ThankYou reward points you get just from having a checking and savings account are tremendous. I have already acquired enough points to cash in $200 worth of gift cards from a huge assortment of retailers.

Simply hoping to save that one chunk of change every year, I wasn\u2019t fully prepared for some of the awesome rewards that I would enjoy with the Citi Dividend Platinum Select Visa Card. Around the same time that I was card-hunting, I was also looking to buy an iPad for personal use. I purchased the iPad immediately upon receiving my Citi Dividend card, and with that one purchase the $500 requirement was met, and I was immediately eligible to receive the $100 cash back bonus. Not only that, but by visiting the Apple store through Citi\u2019s Bonus Cash Center, I earned back an additional 2% on the transaction \u2013 not insignificant for such a pricy item. Since then, the rewards checks have been rolling in. With rewards redeemable in $50 increments, I\u2019ve been surprised at how frequently I\u2019ve been eligible for another check. With a decent credit limit, I\u2019ve been able to earn back quite a bit of cash per month at 1%, and benefitted even more from rotating 3-month promotions offering 5% back on products and services I often planned on buying anyway. Although Citibank\u2019s online interface isn\u2019t quite as useful for monitoring expenses as others (they do not, for example, post the details of pending charges as my previous bank did), the trade-off has been well worth it to avoid the hassle of an annual fee, not to mention the fantastic cash rewards I\u2019ve earned upon my initial purchase and every few months since."},{"date":"2012-07-18","name":"Drew Short","user_id":"wsothr","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I got the Best Buy Credit Card while I was a freshman in college.

Citi gave me a temporary shopping pass that I could use for online purchases immediately, until my new card arrived. There was a small problem with my initial receipt of the card; the application recommended putting down my permanent address (my parents' house) as well as my mailing address. The application stated that my card would be sent to my mailing address. However, my card was sent instead to my permanent address while my parents were away for several months. I was working full-time in my college town, and wasn't able to get home right away to pick it up. Because of this, I couldn't activate my card immediately, and wasn't able to get my online account set up to pay my bill. By the time I got my card, I had missed the first payment date by a few days, which locked me out of the web system. I called Citi and explained the situation.

No late fees or APR penalties were applied!Customer service aside, the card itself is a great starter card. The 0% intro rate is a great deal, especially if you're new to managing credit. The web interface is easy to navigate, and interfaces with the ThankYou reward system.

The minimum required balance for accounts is annoying, but a lot of banks are doing that now and Citibank's minimum is not as high as some of the other big banks. (Basic checking is only $1,500.) Plus, they allow you to combine all your Citi accounts in order to meet it. Customer service over the phone isn't exceptional, but it's not terrible. The only really frustrating aspect of the phone service is that sometimes they need to ask you a series of multiple-choice identity-confirmation questions, but they draw these questions from info they receive about you from OTHER sources, not info you provide to them when you sign up. So I have actually failed these questions on several occasions (because whatever their sources are do NOT always provide accurate multiple-choice options), and when that happens they cannot help you over the phone. That said, I experienced an incident of identity theft on my debit card several months ago, and when I called them Citibank immediately credited me the amount taken, sent me a new card via overnight shipping for free, and took very quick action to resolve the issue.

I had their basic checking account and recently switched to a student checking account. However, when I graduate college in a year, I will most likely discontinue my service. My experience with Citibank checking has been disappointing. I cannot get over the fact that they changed the policy regarding the basic checking account fees -- it used to be no minimum balance, so long as you use your the account for three transactions each month. Citibank changed it, without personally contacting their customers, so that you need either to have a minimum balance, or to pay a number of bills with the account. At the time, I could accomplish neither, and got a nasty monthly fee. After this, I opened a student account, but it was a real hassle closing my basic checking. They said they would close it within a couple of days, in case any transactions were still being handled, but it was never closed and I had to call again. During this process they also pitched a savings account, which apparently had no fees. However, I checked on the website, and the fee is waived only if you have a minimum of $5,000. I'm a college student with very little money so, of course, I had to also close that one (because I opened it on the phone with a representative, who assured me there weren't hidden fees).I'm mostly disappointed at their lack of accounts for those who do not have very much money. Most of their options involve a minimum balance of $5,000. I will be looking into smaller banks after I graduate school.I will say one thing: their customer service is responsive and quick. The representatives genuinely try to help, and quite often they succeed. I was able to open my student account over the phone, and that was a very positive experience. That said, I don't think I should have to communicate as often I as have with Citibank just for a no-frills checking account.In short, it hasn't been the worst experience (thanks to the customer service), but I've been disappointed a number of times.

The cash back reward is not much, but it is nice to have, as I can get 1-5% back on things that I was going to buy anyways.

To be honest, I would expect that with any bank.

We used our card to purchase several new appliances for our home and the interest-free deal was perfect for us and gave us plenty of time to get them paid off before the interest kicked in.That being said, unless you are able to pay off all other purchases quickly, the interest rate is high, typical for store credit cards, and I find it much more favorable to use a rewards card instead for most purchases. I do receive special purchase offers and discounts as a benefit of using my Home Depot card, which I do appreciate. I just make certain to not carry any balance from month to month.

Other than that incident, we've been pretty happy with our loan. I've only needed to call them a couple of times for further assistance (over the last few years) and each time I received satisfactory customer service. I will say though, unless you have multiple products with this bank (like savings, CD, loan, etc) their checking account fees can be really high! Thankfully, because of my husband's relationship with them (and our loan) we have been able to pretty much avoid these fees.

I was approved for, I believe, $900 initially, with hardly any credit. What really got me in was the deals Best Buy offered; interest free for XX months, depending on amount of purchase, as well as RewardZone. I maxed my card out the first day I had it with a TV and a home theater system. I received a good amount of gift certificate value back for that purchase. My maximum allowed to pay off the card was 36 months and was nearly paid off by 24 months. I recently called for a credit line increase, and was increased another $500, and of course came close to maxing that out as well.This card really has its benefits if you buy big. However, I don't see why more people apply for this when all you do is swipe the card, take home your big purchase, and pay it off over the course of say, 18\/24\/36 months with NO interest. It's a great idea for the holidays or even birthdays (family in particular). However, if you don't make an expensive purchase, the benefits may not come into play.If you're a geek and like to shop at Best Buy, I'd highly recommend this card.

The reason I chose Citibank is because they had an online application that was easy to understand and also they had a checking account option that allowed me to open an account without an initial deposit so that my weekly check could be the first money that I deposited. The application process went extremely smoothly and I wish more banks would take note of Citibank's application process. The automatic deposit process for my unemployment checks went through without a single hitch, it was a relief due to the financial position I was in, I really needed to make sure the money was available and they didn't let me down.       Once my unemployment ran out I didn't use the account much due to the fact I didn't have much income. However, I was doing small jobs on an internet site that enabled me to deposit the money I made directly into my bank account. So I decided to use this same Citibank account, what a mistake. I didn't have any problems the first few months. I stopped using checks for this account during this time because I never knew exactly when the money I earned would be deposited. So I would use my debit card so I would not make a mistake and cause any overdrafts. One day I decided to use my Citibank debit card and it was rejected even though I knew there were funds in the account. I went online to see what the problem was and couldn't sign on to my account after trying several times. The next day I still was unable to sign on so I called customer service to see what was going on and they fixed whatever the problem was but explained nothing and gave me no info on my account. I finally signed on and seen my account had been closed due to an overdraft fee that had never been paid off. I tried to find out what this fee was for, because like I said I rarely used this account and never used checks during this time. I can not find the reason for the fee so I called and was hung up on twice. The thing that upset me the most was I had just talked to customer service and they never said anything about my account being closed and then when I call right back to ask about it they hang up like they didn't want to deal with me. I decided just to pay the fee and find another bank, but with the economy the way it is I do not want anyone else to have to go through this. If you are a person like me who does not use an account a lot and therefore you don't check it often then I don't believe this is the bank for you."},{"date":"2012-06-11","name":"Traci","user_id":"phoenixfire","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Mortgages","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"Citibank has been wonderful to myself and my family who also banks there with a mortgage.

In general though, I can tell you that you should only get an airline card if you regularly fly and a AAdvantage Card if you regularly fly American Airlines or one of its partners.  A rewards card is supposed to help you save concistently, not maybe once and a while, and if you save up a bunch of miles like a squirrel preppin for winter, you might wake up one day to find that stash depleted by hawkish credit card company that now requires more for the same rewards.  Anyway, here are what I see as being the pros and cons of the Citi Platinim Select AAdvantage Visa Card (I guess you could say the length of its name is one con!):Pros-\tInitial Bonus:  Anytime you can get a whole heap of free miles is a good thing.  When you get about enough for a free roundtrip flight to the Caribbean, as the Citi AAdvantage Visa Card provides, it\u2019s even better.-\tNo First Year Annual Fee:  You get a lot of value in the first year without having to pay.  And even when you do start to pay in the second year, you get a $100 discount each year for American Airlines flights.-\tAnniversary bonus: Had to list that $100 bonus as its own pro in case someone missed it above.-\tMiles refund:  You get 10% of your annually redeemed miles back, which is another reason why only frequent flyers should get the AAdvantage Visa Signature Card.Cons-\tOngoing rewards:  Double miles on AA purchases and one on every dollar you spend on everything else isn\u2019t great.-\tAnnual fee:  You\u2019d rather not see an annual fee, but its wiped out by the cardholder anniversary present, so it\u2019s not that big a deal.-\tPriority boarding and in flight discounts aren\u2019t rewally anything to write home about, especially since youll just have to sit on the plane longer and in flight purchases tend to be fairly expensive already.Ultimately, the Citi Platinum Select \/ AAdvantage Visa Signature Credit Card is a decent card and makes for a good option for AA customers, but if you\u2019ve got a different airline of choice or have other expenses that are bigger than travel (like gas and groceries) I\u2019d get a card that matches one of them.  For example, the PenFed Platinum Card gives you 5% cash back on gas and the Blue Cash Preferred from Amex offers 6% cash back at supermarkets, 3% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else.  The Chase Sapphire Preferred also offers a $500 initial bonus, so that\u2019s also something to consider."},{"date":"2012-05-02","name":"Margie Cole","user_id":"margie.cole.52","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"I don\u2019t really see what\u2019s so prestigious about spending $500 on a credit card, but I guess me and Citi have different ideas of what prestige is since that\u2019s what the Citi ThankYou Presitge Card charges.  Unless this card offers some awesome rewards or low interest, Citi would certainly have to give you a big ole ThankYou for opening it. Pros-\tTo be frank, I don\u2019t see the Citi Thank You Prestige Card having any positives, so bring on the cons\u2026like a prison break.Cons-\tAnnual Fee:  The annual fee is an obvious drawback.

And if you want a really good balance transfer card, you\u2019ll probably opt for the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card from Chase, which offers 0% for 15 months.  Moving on to rewards, the Citi Thank You Credit Card gives you 1 point per dollar spent across all purchases, which isn\u2019t competitive to say the least.

That\u2019s what first came to my mind when I saw the two different Thank You Premier Citicards, and I bet this confuses a lot of other people as well.  To understand the differences between these two offers, you gotta dig a bit deeper than their names, I found.How they\u2019re the same.Both the $150 gift card Citi Thank You Premier Card and the $250 version require excellent credit and don\u2019t have annual fees.  Neither offers low introductory interest rates (there are three Citicards that offer 0% on both purchases and transfers for 18 months if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after though).  Both have 12.99% - 22.99% APRs, and they\u2019re both obviously Citi ThankYou Premier Cards.  That\u2019s where the similarities end.How they differ.Obviously one of these Citi Thank You Premier Credit Cards gives an initial bonus worth $100 more, but the question is whether the Citicard with the less lucrative offer makes up for this in any way.  Well, it does by giving you 5 points per dollar at supermarkets, gas stations and drug stores for 12 months before settling into the 1 point per dollar spent across all purchases rewards offered by the other Citi ThankYou Preferred Card.  You therefoe have to ask yourself whether these points would add up to $100 over the course of a year.  If they will, then the Citi ThankYou Premier Credit Card - $150 gift card initial bonus version would be better.Which should you choose.I wouldn\u2019t choose either of these cards.

It doesn\u2019t have an annual fee or rewards but does offer a 0% introductory APR for awhile, which makes it pretty much ideal for someone with excellent credit who is either planning a big purchase or wishing to get a lower interest rate for existing credit card debt. Whether or not it\u2019s the best card for this type of person remains to be seen, so her are the pros and cons of picking the Citi Platinum Select Credit Card as I see them.Pros-\t0% purchase APR for 18 months: That\u2019s the longest 0% intro period on the market, so it gives you as long as is currently possible to pay off purchase before interest kicks in or even leave your credit card payments in the bank if you find an account with an interest rate better than the best rewards.-\t0% balance transfer APR for 18 months: As was the case with purchases, the Platinum Select Citicard\u2019s balance transfer APR is the longest on the market. There is however a downside to this card\u2019s balance transfer terms, as you\u2019ll see in the cons.-\tNo annual fee: It\u2019d be kind of counterproductive to try to avoid interest costs when paying an annual fee.Cons-\t3% balance transfer fee: If you transfer a $5,000 balance for example, this will cost you $150.-\tExcellent credit requirement: If you don\u2019t have excellent credit, this could certainly be construed as a con, especially considering the tantalizing terms offered by the Citi Platinum Card.All in all, you can\u2019t do better than the Citi Platinum Select MasterCard or its cousins the Citi Simplicity and the Citi Diamond Preferred (which offer the same terms) if you need as long as possible to pay off an upcoming purchase. If you want to transfer a balance, I\u2019d go with the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card from Chase as long as it\u2019s available because it offers 0% for 15 months and does not charge the same expensive transfer fee.Id love to hear others' thoughts on this matter as well!"},{"date":"2012-03-20","name":"Margie Cole","user_id":"margie.cole.52","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"There are so many credit cards out there that makes things difficult, which is what makes the marketing for the Citi Simplicity Card so effective.

You obviously cant just take it at its name, but luckily deciding whether or not to get it should be fairly simple.  We just need to see what the Citi Simplicity Credit Card offers and how that compares to what the competition offers.  I find that pro\/con lists help in doing so.Pros-The Simplicity Citicard offers 0% on purchases and balance transfers for 18 months (tied for longest available).-Does not charge an annual fee.Cons-\tThe Citi Simplicity Credit Card charges a 3% balance transfer fee.-\tIt has a higher regular rate than some of its direct competitors.-\tNo rewardsOverall, the Citi Simplicity is a great credit card, no doubt about it.  But it is slightly beat out by other cards.  For example, if you want 0% for the longest time possible, you\u2019d probably apply for the Citi Diamond Preferred or the Citi Platinum Select because they too give you 0% for 18 months and have lower regular APRs than the Citi Simplicity Card.  Likewise, if you would rather sacrifice 0% time for a lower transfer fee, the No Balance Transfer Slate Card from Chase offers 0% for 15 months and doesn\u2019t charge a balance transfer fee.  Finally, if you\u2019re after rewards, the Simplicity Card obviously won\u2019t cut it.

You may or may not know it, but a credit card can be a great means of garnering these savings as certain offers give rebates or cash back rates on gas purchases.  One such card is obviously the ExxonMobil Credit Card.  Whether or not you should get this card depends on a few different factors, including obviously what it offers, which we\u2019ll start with in this little review.  The Exxon Mobil Credit Card gets you $0.15 off each gallon of each gallon of gas you purchase at Exxon Mobil Stations.  It also gives you UP TO 2% cash back on all other purchases.  What that means is the Exxon Mobil Card gives you 0.5% on annual non-gas purchases up to $999, 1% on purchases above $1,000 up to $5,999, 2% on purchases above $5,999 up to $10,000, and 1% on all purchases above that.  Those non-gas cash back rates are ok, but the draw of the Exxon Mobil Credit Card is definitely the gas rebate that it provides.  To put it in percentage terms (it\u2019s confusing that credit card companies do not express their rewards in the same manner -  doing so makes the bad offers seem better, I suppose), the Exxon Credit Card gives you 4.1% off each gallon of ExxonMobil gas you buy.Now, I said we\u2019d get to the other factors at play in picking the right gas credit card and here we go.  First of all, only people who ONLY get their gas at ExxonMobil should get the Exxon Mobil Rewards Card.  People who don\u2019t wouldn\u2019t be able to get the value they want from it.  Sure, you could switch to getting your gas only at Exxon stations, but unless that\u2019s extremely convenient, such a change probably won\u2019t last.  Another factor to consider is what other gas rewards cards offer. If you have a station of choice other than Exxon Mobil, it\u2019s a good idea to check out how it\u2019s co-branded credit card compares to the Exxon Card.  People who go to various stations should check out generic gas rewards cards, which are basically cash back cards that offer higher rewards earning rates on gas purchases.  Some of the most interesting offers come from the Pentagon Federal Credit Union.  They offer 5% off gas purchases anywhere.  The Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express is also a good deal because in addition to 2% off gas station and department store purchases, it gives you 3% off at supermarkets and 1% everywhere else."},{"date":"2012-02-03","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"There are a ton of rewards credit cards out there and it can be difficult to figure out which will pad your wallet the most.  No I\u2019m not talking about a squishy card that\u2019s comfortable to sit on, rather a card that will maximize your free cash.  Branding doesn\u2019t provide much of a clue because it seems like every card has \u201cgold\u201d or \u201cplatinum\u201d in its name.  Instead you gotta take a look at exactly what a card offers and figure out its actual practical effect using past months\u2019 spending.  Well, the Citi Dividend Platinum Select Visa Card -- $100 cash back obviously offers a $100 cash back bonus (in return for spending at least $500 in the first three months), but it also offers 5% cash back on purchase categories that change quarterly (which you have to sign up for each quarter) and 1% cash back on everything else.  In terms of rates, the Citi Dividend Platinum Card offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 12 months.  Might seem pretty darn good, but when you consider that you need excellent credit to get Dividend Platinium Citicard, it\u2019s really not.  See, excellent credit can get you hundreds (plural) of dollars in free money or as long as 18 months with 0%.  What about both?  You shouldn\u2019t try to get an all-around credit card because doing so will likely mean sacrificing all-aound.  If a credit card excels in one respect, it usually comes up short in others.  If it doesn\u2019t excel in any area, there are obviously better cards to get.  So instead of opening the Citi Dividend Platinum Select Visa, either focus on getting the best possible card for your main need (e.g. rewards or low interest) or two cards that together provide the best possible terms attainable.As far as rewards go, if youre looking for a card for ongoing use, you should get one with rewards matching your spending habits.  This obviously depends on the individual, but some good cards to start with are the Blue Cash Everyday and Blue Cash Preferred from Amex.  If you want a great initial balance, go for the Chase Sapphire Preferred.  If you want the longest possible 0% rate, there are three citicards offering it for 18 months.

The Platinum Card is one of three Citicards that offers 0% on purchases as well as balance transfers for 21 months (along with the Citi Simplicity and Diamond Preferred Cards).  Since 21 months is the longest 0% term available, the obvious question is does the Citi Platinum Select MasterCard differentiate itself at all from its cousins, so to speak, or does it make no difference which offer you choose?  Well, the Platinum Select Citicard is exactly the same as the Diamond Preferred Card, both have 11.99% - 21.99% (V) APRs and no annual fee.  The Simplicity Card only differs in that it has a 12.99% - 21.99% (V) APR. Ok, but who are these cards right for?  Both the Citi Platinum Card or the Diamond Preferred would be extremely helpful for people who need to lower the cost of debt, either an existing balance or an upcoming big-ticket purchase.  There is another interesting application for these cards as well, however.  If your bank account, gives you a lucrative interest rate, you could simply make minimum payments over the first 21 months with your card, leaving the rest of your would be payments to grow in the bank for longer.  Whether this makes sense obviously depends on your interest rate and the rewards you could get from other cards.  Keep in mind that a card like the Discover More Card offers 0% for 15 months and gives you rewards, which means that you could earn both interest and rewards revenue if you use it for the approach laid out above."},{"date":"2012-01-25","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"I\u2019ll tell ya what, no matter how good the Citi Diamond Preferred Card is, I\u2019d \u201cprefer\u201d and actual \u201cdiamond.\u201d  It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone who wouldn\u2019t, so let\u2019s move past that premise to what the Diamond Preferred Citi Card does and does not offer.  First of all, it doesn\u2019t have rewards (a bad thing) or annual fees (a good thing).  It does, however, offer a 0% APR for purchases and balance transfers for 21 months.  That means you could buy a diamond (or another big-ticket item) with the Citi Diamond Preferred Credit Card and have the opportunity to pay for it interest free.  You could also leave your would be credit card payments in the bank for 21 months, so that you can earn the good kind of interest (make sure to still make minimum payments if you take this approach).  But you could not leave your payments in the bank while earning rewards on the purchases you make with the Diamond Preferred Card and in doing so double your free money because the Diamond Preferred Card doesn\u2019t offer rewards.  The Discover More Card offers the best chance to do this because it has 0% on purchases and transfers for 21 months as well as cash back rewards on every purchase.  Whether you get the More Card or the Citibank Diamond Preferred seems depends on your ability to pay your bills in the 0% time allotted and how your bank account\u2019s interest rate compares to the More Card\u2019s rewards earning rate (i.e. whether you would get more from 21 months of 0% or 15 months with rewards).Ultimately, while the Citi Diamond Preferred Card is not the card to get if you want rewards, it is one of the best offers out there for people looking for lower interest costs.  It\u2019s not too unique though in the sense that the Citi Simplicity and Platinum Select Cards both offer 0% for 21 months as well (the Simplicity Card offers a slightly higher regular interest rate range than the other two)."},{"date":"2012-01-20","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"Much of college is about promise and potential, building knowledge and improving career prospects.  All of these things are forward-looking, so it\u2019s no wonder why Citi calls its student credit card the Citi Forward Card for College Students; it leads you to think that this is the card that will leave you best set up for a bright future.  Whether this is just clever branding remains to be seen though.  The Citi Forward College Student Credit Card does not have an annual fee, which means it passes the first test for student credit cards.  (Credit building is the main reason to have a student credit card and having no annual fee helps you build credit as inexpensively as possible, especially since you can build credit without actually using your card to make purchases). The next thing most students will want to know is what rewards the Citi Forward Card offers.  Well, it gives you 1,000 bonus points when you sign up for paperless statements during the first three months as well as 100 bonus points each month you pay on time and stay under your balance.  You should be able to garner all 2,200 of these bonus points since you\u2019re likely more comfortable with digital account management and you\u2019d have to opt-in for the ability to exceed your limit anyway (should not do so unless you trust yourself to go over-limit only in emergencies).  You also get 5 points for each dollar you spend at restaurants and on books, music, and movies.  Overall, this rewards structure is good in the sense that it rewards proper account management and gives you points on some of a college student\u2019s biggest expenses.  Whether it offers the best rewards depends on how much you will use your credit card.  If you will use your card a lot and for all kinds of purchases, something like the Capital One Journey Card, which provides 1.25% cash back on all purchases might be better.  If you plan on using your card minimally and only for food, entertainment and books, for example, then Citi\u2019s Student Forward Card could provide could provide more benefit in bonus points alone than you\u2019d get via an entire year using a different student card.  The Discover Open Road Card is a good option for commuters since it gives you 2% cash back on the first $250 you spend on gas and at restaurants each month as well as 1% on everything else.You might be thinking that I forgot about rates.  I didn\u2019t, but they are generally not as important as other card features given that students should not be spending more than they can afford to pay.  The Citi Forward Card for College Students does offer 0% on purchases for seven months though, which makes it middle of the road in the student category.

They really need to figure that out.

Whether these clues will actually lead you to the right credit card for business is another story though, one which requires a closer look to determine the ending.  First of all, the Citi Business World MasterCard offers 10,000 bonus points for spending at least $300 in the first three months, and these points are redeemable for a $100 gift card.  You also get 3 ThankYou points for every dollar spent on office supplies and professional services and one point per dollar spent on everything else.  You can redeem ThankYou points for merchandise, travel rewards, gift cards, cash and more but the number of points needed for different rewards is what actually matters.  Well, with 8,000 points  you can get $50.  In other words, while you get to redeem your initial bonus points at a rate of 1%, yiu get less than that with the points you earn on an ongoing basis. Oh, and the Business World MasterCard from Citi DOES have a foreign transaction fee of 3% which begs the question of what is so worldly about the card to begin with.Regardless, you\u2019re going to need some alternatives because the Citi Business MasterCard is not rewarding enough to cut it.  If you crave simplicity the obvious choice is the Capital One Spark Cash for Business since it offers 2% cash back across all purchases.  Someone wanting to maximize their initial benefit might like the Ink Bold with Ultimate Rewards since it offers 50,000 bonus points, redeemable for $500 cash or $625 in travel.  Either way its important to note that the best business credit card stratrgy these days is to use a rewards business credit card (like the CitiBusiness World MasterCard and the other cards mentioned previously) for everyday purchases and a 0% consumer credit card for funding.

In general you should only get a gas credit card if gas is one of your biggest expenses and a gas card tied to a particular chain if you ONLY get gas at its locations.  So if you are either a loyal Shell customer or live in an area that enables you to cast your allegiances with one of many stations, you may be interested in the Shell Credit Card.  The Shell Card, which requires good or excellent credit for approval, does not have an annual fee but does offer a 10 cents\/gallon credit for the first 100 gallons of Shell gasoline you purchase each month following a month in which you made at least $500 in qualifying purchases.  When you spend $1,000-$2,499.99, you get 15 cents\/gal. and when you spend over $2,499.99 you get 20 cents off per gallon. The Shell Card obviously does not have the most straightforward rewards program ever devised (and I would not spend more than you would ordinarily in order to get to a higher rewards earning level) but it could be fairly lucrative one, depending on the price of gas and what \u201cqualifying purchases\u201d are.  A quick look at the Shell site will tell you that qualifying purchases are those made for personal, family or household reasons, so its only business expenses that don\u2019t count.  For the week of 01\/09\/12, regular gas costs an average of 3.382\/gal. nationwide.  The 10 cent per gallon rebate would therefore equate to about 3% cash back on 100 gallons of Shell gas.  For someone who fills up once a week and puts say 14 gallons of gas in their car each time, the Shell Credit Card would save about $5.60 each month.  For comparison sake, the Exxon Credit Card gives you 15 cents per gallon rebates that are not constrained by gallon limits.  It also gives you up to 2% cash back on everything else you buy each year.  The BP Credit Card also gives you 10% off BP gas for the first 60 days and 5% after that as well as attractive cash back rates on other purchase categories.  The Blue Cash Everyday Credit Card offers 3% cash back at supermarkets, 2% at any gas station or grocery store and 1% on everything else.  This makes it clear that the Shell Credit Card is competitive but that there are also other more attractive offers out there.  If you can easily get your gas from either Exxon or BP, their credit cards would be more lucrative (The Shell Card beats the Exxon Card for heavy spenders though).  If you want the freedom to get gas anywhere but still earn rewards on it and other types of purchases then the Blue Cash Card would be better.  Ultimately, only people who can only get gas at Shell Stations should get the Shell Credit Card and even they should think about whether a gas oriented cash back card like the Blue Cash would better meet their needs."},{"date":"2012-01-12","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":2,"review":"Just because you are an executive or one of the world\u2019s elite (or you just want to be) doesn\u2019t mean you have to pay like it.

Plenty of cards offer initial bonuses in the 25k mile range and base rewards earning rates in the 2 mile\/$1 spent range, so these aspects of the Citi Executive AAdvantage World Elite MasterCard Credit Card do not validate its cost.

One common way to do so is opening a store card or a credit card affiliated with a certain retailer in order to get extra savings on purchases you are likely to make anyway.  If you or someone you plan on giving gifts to likes Brooks Brothers, you may come across this Brooks Brothers Credit Card, and the question you will inevitably ask is whether it is worth applying for.  The Brooks Brothers Credit Card is offered by GE Money and requires good to excellent credit for approval.  So if you don\u2019t have at least good credit you can forget about getting it, at least for the moment.  If you have upper echelon credit history, you need to determine how the Brooks Brothers Credit Card\u2019s rewards stack up against other cards on the market.  This card gets you 15% off on your first Brooks Brothers purchase, 4 points for every dollar you spend at Brooks Bros. and1 point for every dollar spent elsewhere.  Since Brooks Brothers rewards points automatically translate into a $20 gift card when you compile 20,000 of them, at best, you get $20 for every $5,000 you spend at the store. I know prices are high at Brooks Brothers, but that\u2019s really not much bang for your buck.  Let\u2019s say you decide to take advantage of the store\u2019s 2 suits for $1599 deal this Christmas, you\u2019ll save almost $240 and will need to spend about $3400 more to get an additional $20 off.  $240 and change is nothing to sneeze at, but the truth is that you can do better than what the Brooks Brothers GE Money Credit Card offers.If you decide to apply for the Chase Saphirre Preferred Credit card for instance, you get a $500 cash initial bonus after spending $3,000 in the first three months.  You\u2019d easily be able to meet this threshold if you buy a couple suits at Brooks Bros. for the holidays and would then have more money to replenish your bank account than the Brooks Brothers Credit Card would provide, you\u2019d just have to wait a bit longer to get it.  So my advice is to pass on the Brooks Brothers Credit Card because, ironically enough, a different credit card could help save you more on Brooks Brothers purchases."},{"date":"2011-11-30","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":2,"review":"Citi is saying Thank You for keeping up your excellent credit throughout the recession by offering you $250 in gift cards after you spend $2,000 during the first three months with the Citi ThankYou Preferred Card.  Come to think of it they\u2019re probably saying Thank You for spending that much too and giving them the interchange fees that result, but hey.  A lot of credit card companies are offering these initial rewards bonuses for new customers, and since gift cards are established as the most popular presents (I don\u2019t really know what this says about us), the Citi ThankYou Preferred\u2019s bonus might seem pretty darn handy.  But if you are opening a new credit card with just the initial bonus in mind you can do better believe it or not.  The Chase Sapphire Preferred would be a good card to target because it gives you either $625 in airline and hotel expenses or $500 cash.  If you want a combo of a good bonus and ongoing rewards, it bears seeing what else the Citi ThankYou Preferred Card offers.  Not too much it seems.  Just 1 point per $1 spent and an \u201canniversary bonus\u201d whatever that means.  The ThankYou Premier Card doesn\u2019t have a low introductory interest rate either.  So I\u2019d probably say that you should definitely explore other options before applying for this Citi Premier Card.  I\u2019d recommend the Capital One Venture Card, the Sapphire Card mentioned before and the version of the Citi ThankYou Premier Card that offers $500 in gift cards.  Yeah, there are apparently two of these babies.  The difference between them (besides the gift card bonus amount obviously) is that the version with the lower bonus does not have an annual fee ever and the one with the higher bonus has a $125 fee beginning in the second year.  I\u2019d say thanks but no thanks to the $250 version of the Citi ThankYou Premier Card as a result and why thank you to either the version with a better bonus or one of the other cards mentioned in this little review."},{"date":"2011-11-21","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"It\u2019s officially gift card season, so you might be tempted to open the Citi ThankYou Premier Card, as it offers an initial bonus of $500 in gift cards after you spend $2,500 during the first three months.  But before you pull the trigger and submit an application, you should know exactly what else this card offers as well as how it ranks among the competition.  The only really worthwhile things that the Citi ThankYou Premier Credit Card offers is 1.2 points per dollar spent at gas stations, supermarkets, drug stores, and commuter transportation and parking merchants and 1 point per dollar spent on everything else.  The free annual companion airline ticket and 15% discounts on air travel you get when booking through Sprint Incentives probably won\u2019t be a great deal because Sprint Inventive fares are bound to be much higher than discount comparison sites like Expedia and Kayak.As a result, I\u2019d have to say that there are better choices than the Citi ThankYou Card out there if you\u2019re looking to get a new credit card this holiday season.  I mean the Chase Sapphire Preferred is offering an initial bonus worth $500 - $625, depending on how you choose to redeem the bonus points you get for spending $3,000 in the first three months.  The Capital One Cash Credit Card offers 1.5% cash back across all purchases.  The Capital One Venture Card is basically a travel-oriented 2% cash back card.  Like the ThankYou Card from Citi, none of these cards charge membership fees in the first year.  Unlike the Citi ThankYou Card, these cards all have membership fees in subsequent years that are less than $125.  I\u2019d therefore have to recommend saying ThankYou but no ThankYou about the ThankYou Premier Card."},{"date":"2011-11-21","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"Are you a forward thinker?  By that I, of course, mean are you thinking about opening the Citi Forward Card?  If so, you should be well aware of exactly what it offers, how practically attractive these offerings are, and how they stack up to the rest of the above-average credit card market.  I fancy myself as somewhat of an amateur credit card expert, so here\u2019s my two cents on this card; I hope it helps.In terms of rewards, the Citi Forward Credit Card offers 10,000 bonus points for spending $650 and signing up for paperless statements within the first three months.  This initial rewards bonus is redeemable for $100 in gift cards.  You also get 5 points per dollar spent at restaurants and on entertainment (i.e. books, movies, and music) as well as 1 point per dollar spent on everything else.  In terms of interest rates, the Forward Card offers 0% on purchases for seven months and 0% on balance transfers for 12 months (3% balance transfer fee).  After these intro rates expire, a 12.99% - 22.99% variable interest rate kicks in.  Which end of the spectrum you regular interest rate ends up being on is determined by your credit standing.Ultimately, this card does a little bit of everything pretty well, but nothing is exceptional.  If you are interested in a card with a good initial bonus, the Chase Sapphire Preferred is a better option.  If you need an everyday rewards card, I\u2019d argue that the Capital One Venture Card is better than the Citi Forward Card because it is basically a 2% cash back card if you redeem for any travel related purchase and it also has a $100 initial rewards bonus.  Alternatively, if you don\u2019t travel much, a card like the Capital One Cash Rewards Credit Card offers 1.5% across all purchases and would probably prove more lucrative than the Citi Forward Card because most people\u2019s spending exceeds the bounds of restaurant and entertainment purchases.  Finally, if you are interested in a low introductory interest rate, then the Citi Simplicity Card is the way to go, since it offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 21 months.  So, you probably should not move forward with the Citi Forward Credit Card."},{"date":"2011-11-11","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":2,"review":"Shortly after the new iPhone dropped, I reviewed the AT&T Universal Savings Platinum Credit Card, and it just occurred to me that I should take a look at what its business cousin, the AT&T Universal Business Credit Card, has to offer.  The AT&T Universal Business Card is for small business owners who have good or excellent personal credit scores (very important to realize).  It\u2019s a Citicard on the Visa network and doesn\u2019t have an annual fee, but you\u2019re obviously going to be most interested in the rewards it does have.  This card offers 5 Citi ThankYou points for each dollar you charge on AT&T-related purchases, 3 points for purchases made through certain office suppliers, gas stations and professional services companies, and 1 point on everything else.  You might be wondering what \u201ccertain\u201d means, and according to the card\u2019s rewards program details, \u201cOffice supply merchants are defined as stand-alone merchants that primarily sell stationery and office supplies for business consumption. Gas stations are defined as stand-alone merchants that primarily sell vehicle fuel for consumer use. Professional services are defined as standalone tax preparation, accounting, bookkeeping, and legal services providers that provide their respective services to businesses.\u201d  Apparently warehouse clubs, discount stores and convenience stores don\u2019t count.The above might all seem like a lot to keep track of and for that exact reason, I\u2019d stay away from the AT&T Universal Business Credit Card.  I\u2019m not a small business owner, but I know a few people who are and they have more than enough to worry about without fussing over what types of purchases qualify for X or Y amount of rewards.  If I had to choose, I\u2019d probably go with the Capital One cash business credit card over the AT&T business credit card cause it gives you 2% on all purchases, making it a whole lot simpler."},{"date":"2011-11-04","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"The Hilton ladies have garnered quite a bit of attention throughout the years, but what about a different type of Hilton plastic (get it, they\u2019ve probably had work done), the Citi Hilton HHonors Credit Card?  What does it have to offer the world?  For starters, this Visa card which requires at least good credit of applicants offers an initial rewards bonus of 40,000 Hilton HHonors points.  You get these after spending at least $1k during the first four months you have the Citi Hilton Credit Card.  That\u2019s pretty good, but it also isn\u2019t uncommon for affinity rewards cards these days.  The Citi Hilton HHonors Credit Card also has a base rewards structure that provides 6 HHonors points for each dollar spent at Hilton Hotels; 3 points for each dollar spent on supermarket, drugstore and gas station purchases; and 2 points per $1 on everything else.  Finally, you automatically have Hilton HHonors Silver Status as a Citi Hilton Credit Card holder.This begs the question of how many points it takes to get a free night and what Silver Status scores you.  Well, 40,000 points gets you one free night in a really nice Hilton Hotel and 3 nights in one of the company\u2019s, and Silver Status gets you 15% more base points, free access to spas and fitness centers at Hilton hotels and 2 complimentary bottles of water at certain Hilton hotels [I don\u2019t know about you, but those bottles sealed the deal for me ;) ].Before wrapping up this look at the Citi Hilton Credit Card it is important to note that like the Hilton twins, there is also more than one Hilton Credit Card.  In addition to the Citi Hilton Card, a Hilton HHonors Surpass Credit Card is also available.  This card offers slightly better rewards, but has a $75 annual fee.  In case I didn\u2019t mention it, the Hilton Citicard does not have an annual membership fee."},{"date":"2011-11-01","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"We all know that Best Buy Gift Cards will be a popular gift this holiday season, but what about the Best Buy Credit Card?  Could it also play an important role in your holiday spending?  Well, this store card offers 2 points per $1 spent at Best Buy and Best Buy.com.  250 points gets you a $5 gift card, so for every $125 you spend at Best Buy, the Best Buy Credit Card saves you $5.  That makes the Best Buy card essentially a 4% cash back credit card on store purchases, which is pretty good if you plan on doing most of your shopping at Best Buy.  Some interesting financing offers are also part of the Best Buy Credit Card.  If you pay down purchases totaling $149 \u2013 $429 within 6 months, you won\u2019t be charged interest.  If you pay down those totaling $429 - $899 within 12 months, there\u2019s no interest.  And the same thing is true if you pay down purchases of $899 and up within 18 months.   Given that the holiday season is the busiest shopping time of the year and electronics are popular gifts, these deals could be helpful in paying down purchases you can\u2019t initially cover with cash.  Still, this card only has value if you are a diehard Best Buy shopper, and no matter your store preferences, I would recommend taking a look at cash back rewards cards and balance transfer cards to see if any provide equal or more value than the Best Buy Credit Card AND allow you to earn your rewards or apply your low interest rate to purchases made at any store."},{"date":"2011-10-27","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":2,"review":"While you kind of expect an interesting rewards structure from gas credit cards, you\u2019d hope that the terms would be somewhat better than what the CITGO Credit Card is offering.  Sure, you get 4% rebates on \u201cqualifying\u201d Citgo purchases, but c\u2019mon, only 0.5% on all other annual purchases under $5,000 and 1% on everything above that mark?  That might not seem so bad until you consider that the BP Credit Card for example gives you 10% on BP purchases, 4% on travel and dining and 2% on the rest for 60 days, and 5%, 2% and 1% after that.  You\u2019re probably not going to get the BP Credit Card instead of the CITGO Card, since they are both affiliated gas credit cards and you pretty much have to only get gas at your affiliated card\u2019s station to make it worth it. The comparison just shows that CITGO isn\u2019t necessarily as competitive as you\u2019d like with its competitors and if you are a CITGO customer, getting the CITGO credit card might not be as big of a no brainer as you thought.

I started by looking at the card bearing the name of one of the main cell networks carrying the iPhone:  the AT&T Universal Savings Platinum Credit Card.  This AT&T credit card--which is issued by Citibank, offered on the MasterCard network, and requires good or excellent credit for approval\u2014unfortunately does not offer an initial rewards bonus.  What it does have is a rather interesting rewards structure.  Instead of providing a set cash back rate across all purchases with potentially better rewards on certain spending categories, the AT&T Universal Savings Platinum Credit Card offers tiered rewards.  Each month, you get 0.5% cash back for purchases up to $250 spent, 1% between $250 and $750, and 1.5% above $750.  Considering that the Capital One Cash credit card offers 1.5% on all purchases, regardless of how much you spend, what the AT&T card has to offer in terms of rewards isn\u2019t all that good.  Neither card, by the way, has an annual fee.  Interestingly, the AT&T Universal Savings Platinum Credit Card does have a pretty attractive balance transfer offer:  0% on transfers for 15 months with a 3% balance transfer fee.  While there are at least nine other cards currently on the market offering 0% for at least that long (some as long as 21 months) at least the AT&T card is in the upper echelon.  Still, I wouldn\u2019t suggest going into debt to buy the iPhone and then transferring your balance to this card.  The balance transfer fee makes this costly and not worth the risk, especially since you might not even get approved for a balance transfer."},{"date":"2011-09-29","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"Forget the Great Recession, what happened to the Red Sox over the past month has to be the biggest collapse that we\u2019ve seen in a long while, but as a Yankees fan I\u2019m certainly not complaining.  Instead, I\u2019m trying to save on a flight to Detroit on Oct. 3 (hopefully to see a sweep) as well as (fingers crossed) flights to Tampa or Arlington and any National League City that wants a piece of the 27-time World Series champs.  Since credit cards affiliated with airlines have recently been offering free flights just for signing up and American Airlines serves all of the cities with teams in the playoffs, why not see what their credit card has to offer?  It only seems right to take America\u2019s airline to see America\u2019s baseball team dominate after all.As it turns out, Citi offers a number of cards that are affiliated with American Airlines, and this Citi Gold \/ AAdvantage World MasterCard Credit Card offers the most lucrative initial bonus\u201430,000 bonus miles.  Unfortunately, the fact that cardholders only get these cards after spending $750 in the first fourth months makes it of little immediate benefit to me.  But, after checking out a few other cards tied to different airlines, I have learned that these spending requirements are more of the norm than the exception.  The Citi Gold AAdvantage MasterCard actually stacks up pretty well against similar cards.  Only the Continental Airlines Credit Card and the United MileagePlus cards have the potential to offer more lucrative initial bonuses and though the Citi AAdvantage card has a slightly higher APR, its annual fee is $45 less than those charged by these other cards.  So, while I\u2019m not going to apply for this card and you can probably do better if an initial bonus is what you\u2019re after, if you\u2019re an American Airlines frequent flyer, it could be a good addition to your wallet."},{"date":"2011-08-12","name":"Joe Weider","user_id":"joe_weider","verified":false,"product":"Citibank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"When it comes to getting a card with a 0% APR I have not found a credit card that can beat the Simplicity Card - 0% for 21 months on both purchases and balance transfers is amazing!
