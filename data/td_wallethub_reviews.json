As such, it\u2019s a great way to invest in your credit standing. This card also offers a decent initial bonus and solid ongoing rewards, at least in percentage terms, giving you a $20 rebate on a purchase of at least $100 the day of account opening and then the points equivalent of 2% back on Nordstrom purchases. Plus, you\u2019ll benefit from free alterations, \u201ctriple-points days\u201d and other Nordstrom deals.  But it\u2019s important to note that most of that package is easily replaceable by another credit card. So you shouldn\u2019t lose any sleep if you choose to let this offer slip by. And if you\u2019re on the fence about whether to apply, you can learn more from our in-depth Nordstrom Credit Card review: https:\/\/wallethub.com\/edu\/nordstrom-credit-card-review\/25965\/."},{"date":"2020-04-20","name":"WalletHub","user_id":"WalletHub","verified":false,"product":null,"review_comment":true,"stars":4,"review":"TD Bank Personal Loan ReviewTD Bank offers inexpensive personal loans, with APRs starting at 6.99% and stopping at a maximum of 18.99%. That\u2019s around half as high as the 36% maximum possible from many other major lenders. TD Bank is also unique in that it\u2019s one of a handful of major lenders that offer not just unsecured personal loans but secured loans as well. TD\u2019s unsecured loans don\u2019t charge origination fees, but there\u2019s a $50 fee on secured loans. One drawback to TD Bank is that they only operate in 15 states and D.C. However, people who do live in areas the bank services will be able to enjoy competitive terms on their loans. Customers can borrow up to $50,000 and can get up to 60 months to pay their loans off. TD also has a good reputation from the BBB and from their customers, which means consumers can borrow with confidence. TD Bank Personal Loan Review Highlights: \u2022\tAPRs: 6.99% to 18.99%\u2022\tLoan sizes: $2,000 to $50,000\u2022\tPayoff periods: 12 to 60 months\u2022\tCredit score requirement: 750+ (660+ for TD customers)\u2022\tOrigination fee: $0 for unsecured, $50 for secured \u2022\tOther fees: $5 late payment fee\u2022\tReputation: Payoff scores an A+ with the Better Business Bureau and has a 3.8\/5 user rating on WalletHub.\u2022\tCo-signers: AllowedAltogether, TD Bank personal loans are a great option for those fortunate enough to live in one of the states the bank services.

That cherry comes in the form of a $100 initial bonus for spending just $500 within 90 days of account approval and the offer\u2019s lack of an annual fee. The middling nature of the offer comes from its 1% cash-back base earning rate (supplemented by just 2% back only on dining); its unfavorable regular APR; and a 4% balance-transfer fee that ruins the availability of 0% financing on balance transfers for the first 12 months.All things considered, this isn\u2019t a bad card to have in your wallet if you\u2019re a relatively light spender who has excellent credit, pays with credit primarily when dining out and never carries a balance from month to month. In such a scenario, it won\u2019t cost you a thing and will provide a decent rewards yield without requiring much thought. But if you want to get the best credit card possible, this isn\u2019t the offer for you. The excellent-credit corner of the market is quite competitive, and there are better deals to be had whether you\u2019re in the market for rewards or low-cost financing.

TD Credit card responded by freezing my card until I could verify my identity. They did not notify me of this; my card was simply declined 7 days after I had moved.I called TD credit card customer service, who provided me with an actual address for a TD bank location in Rochester... which closed five years ago. I then called back, and was told I had to verify my identity with 2 forms of ID. I was told to fax them over to a number (the supervisor, Preston, was unsure which ID would fit that requirement, however) I then called in 3 days later, asking if my identity had been verified so I could use my card. I was then told that the fax number provided was incorrect. I then refaxed everything (paying out of pocket; I do not have a fax) and was told it was received 2 days afterwards. However, I was informed it was pending review, and was told to call again in 3 days. I called again in 3 days, however, I was then told I also needed to provide a copy of my utility bill. This had not been mentioned to me. I was then told to fax my 5 page utility bill (keep in mind faxing is $2.19 per page near me)I have asked to cancel this card numerous times, only to be sent to a customer service rep who then sends me back to the TD line I was on. Everyone on the phone is super unhelpful and simply wants you to hang up. I urge anyone to stay away from TD bank as much as you can.

I thought once in the house, the nightmare would end but it's only gotten worse - I've had a problem every month. Credit score affected by their incompetence, first when they had to run it multiple times when they passed me through 4 different loan processors, and now because each time they tell me a payment is made via phone or walking into my local branch, there is an error. For example, this month instead of issuing the payment as a payment, they added to my account as an \"unapplied fund,\" which did not count as a payment and then they issued me a late fee, so the unapplied funds were now less than my payment by $13 so they weren't applied again, therefore another late fee.

I promise you that is the absolute only reason I'm stuck with this absurd bank. I have had my checking account blocked twice for no reason when I needed my card the most and thanks to them I've experienced hunger on a whole new level. One of the Worst feelings in the world is to know you have money but have no access to it because someone else decided to block card access until they feel there's no fraudulent activity. The funniest part is that when there was actual fraudulent activity due to a site stealing my card info, they let it go thru and refused to reimburse me. I explained I never authorized such an order and was told in 100 ways that there was nothing they could do. Oh let me add that when I called to have this hold\/block on my account lifted, they told me that I had to contact a completely different department. If you have your account linked to PayPal and transfer funds but while transferring PayPal gives an error msg that caused you to make another attempt at the same transfer, then realize the error msg didn't matter because the first transfer did in fact go thru so you contact them to cancel the second Transfer, they will tell you that you missed the 24 hr deadline. So it's my fault that you ppl had me on hold 2 hrs and 57 mins to then disconnect and make me start over all day until there was no option left but to wait? Absolutely absurd and good luck if you plan to open a Savings account in hopes of making your money grow....lol might as well consider yourself BROKE FOREVER? Worst INCONVENIENT Bank in the world. They need to change their disrespectful ads as well because they don't believe in low or middle-class folks deserving any perks. They offer a $200 bonus for new Customers that open an account and deposit 20k into their account within an extremely sad amount of time so needless to say that if you make minimum wage or your income is SSI\/SSD then u just won't get that little 200 bucks. The average person doesn't even make 20k in a year let alone in a couple months. Seriously stop with the BS ads. They should say \"ARE YOU WEALTHY AND WANT TO BE JUST A LITTLE WEALTHIER, THEN OPEN AN ACCOUNT WITH US.\" Can't wait to leave this pathetic bank that does nothing but take from us.

I requested an extension to my car loan back in November as I was unemployed, and they accepted it. They told me all I had to do was pay the interest fees. Great! Except... apparently there's paperwork that I had to fill out that I was neither informed of, nor sent in any way. I received a call after the first week of December of them telling me that I haven't paid my bill for November yet. Once I told them that I requested an extension, they told me I had to fill out and send back the paperwork they sent me. Well, I informed them that I never received said paperwork, and they promised to get it sent out to me. Well, they didn't, and I kept receiving phone calls that I had to pay, and that they would send the paperwork after the call. This went on for several weeks, until someone finally got it through to me through their secure message center. The following day, I got it printed, signed, and faxed over through Staples as I don't have a fax machine, and even paid to get it done.Fast forward to the following week, I call to make sure that they received it, and they said that they did but it had to take a couple days to process. I was patient, but it never finished processing, so I called back and they told me I sent them the wrong paperwork. I told them that I just sent what they sent me, but it turns out they sent me the wrong paperwork. So they send a new one and I send that one, paying for it again. However, while this was all happening, we got threats about my credit taking a hit if we didn't start paying soon, TD told me not to worry about it. Well, they never processed that paperwork and my credit indeed took a hit. I was livid, and called back. They told me AGAIN that I sent the wrong paperwork. It told them that I had sent them paperwork twice now, and I'm not sending them anymore. I finally got through to someone who knew what he was doing, and he said he would take care of it. I was also told that they would contact the credit agency themselves and get things straightened out. At first I thought we were finally set. My bill was back to normal, and my account showed no signs of having any late bills. However, this week I received a letter saying that my dispute was denied, and after investigating they found they did nothing wrong. How is it that TD contacted them themselves and they still denied it?? On top of that, I can't call or email them so I called TD back and they don't know what's going on either. I've had enough, this has been going on for months and I have every right to contact my lawyer and have this taken care of, because this is absolutely ridiculous. I tried so hard to be patient and understanding but all I did was get stepped on and abused by them. If you're considering using TD for your auto loan, DON'T. They will refuse to do any work that they're required to, and YOU'RE going to suffer because of it. If you care at all about your credit, stay far away from them."},{"date":"2021-03-18","name":"emilio","user_id":"emiliovaldes1","verified":true,"product":"TD Bank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"Is a good card with good rewards, if that is your primary objective go ahead.

Before I explain why this is one of the worst cards to have, I will disclose some information used to evaluate my creditworthiness. Over the past 24 months my credit score has been anywhere between 802 and 823. I make 160k+ per annum and never utilize more than a 3% of my overall credit. Upon opening my Target RedCard, I was only given a $2000 credit limit. After about a month I asked for an increase which was denied. Around 3 or 4-months later I asked again and was only granted a CL of $3500. This means that if I do not want this cards balance to adversely effect my credit score by keeping it under 10% of the balance I can only spend a max of $350 on any given month. A few months after the increase to $3500 I purchased a NetGear router, Air Pods and few other less expensive items totaling around $550. Durning this same billing cycle Target decided they should decrease my CL to $1000 without any written or verbal notice. The > 50% utilization caused my credit score to drop around 17 points. Furthermore, they were unwilling to increase my CL. Credit score declines from an increased utilization percent are temporary. Once you pay it off, your credit score should return to where it was previously (given there are no other changes in your credit). So no big deal, right? Wrong! Out of nowhere Target decides to close my RedCard. Targets decision to close my card is permanent and has several deleterious effects on my credit. 1. I have had this card for many years and it reduced my average age of credit history.2. Shows up as closed account for which no more payments can be made and it remains on credit report as closed for another 7 to 10 years.3. To get another Target RedCard I would need to reapply which results in a hard credit pull. As you know this also dings your credit score.4. It will most likely effect your overall credit card utilization rate. Not so much for me since the last CL on my RedCard was only $1000.In summary, this is one of the worst credit cards for new and long time credit card holders because of business practices employed by TD Bank. This card is not worth the 5% back even when you consider a signup bonus gift card of $25 or $50. DO NOT APPLY FOR THIS CARD.

Then they wouldn't let me transfer more than $1000 from another bank, even though there was a minimum balance requirement of $20,000. They told me to call a branch. The branch told me to call the phone line. Finally, I went into a branch, which I hadn't wanted to do, and they said they knew nothing about the promotion, but finally allowed me to write a check. Then they sent me a Debit card and when I tried to get online to activate it, the online activation kept saying I was giving the wrong information, and when I called the message didn't give me the option of activating.

Three months later auto payments have been implemented without issues. But TD Bank decided to send me the same auto payment paperwork to be completed....again. I called to see why this was needed. After talking with two associates I gave up. Both were very rude and seemed to take little interest in helping and more interested in making sure I understood that they were in charge.

ARCHIVED RE: Transactions Jan 07, 2021 Hello Rachel, We're sorry to hear that you weren't able to receive the help you needed when you called us. After reviewing your account, we found that your bank returned the recent payment of $121 payment because the bank account saved online was deemed as an invalid bank account. Your RedCard account was charged a fee due to this returned payment. We're sorry, but we\u2019re unable to remove the returned payment fee from your account. We understand that this may not be the outcome you were looking for, but we hope you understand that we must remain consistent with our credit policies, in fairness to all our accountholders. Unfortunately, we're unable to arrange for a phone call to you through an online message request. We're sorry for any disappointment. Thank you for taking the time to contact us through Manage My RedCard.

Three stars reflects TD's broken system dealing with pending credits and debits.  They process same day transactions sequentially based on a time stamp.

I called 2 months prior to inform them that I was having hardship due to the pandemic. I paid a sum of $600 at the end of September or the beginning of October when I spoke to a representative I was told this could be dispersed over two months. In December I received a call for payment which I thought I took care of within the $600 payment. Now I didn\u2019t complain because I had the cash, so I paid the minimum balance. Now here\u2019s my issue I am in the process of buying a home. Nordstrom reported a derogatory claim which caused my credit to drop 116 points.I have never had an issue paying, and I always know to communicate if so. I communicated to all my creditors and the only issue was Nordstrom. When I called to speak to a representative and I asked her why this issue during a pandemic I was told Nordstrom does not offer any accommodation for the pandemic. At that point I asked to speak to a supervisor whose name was Ashley (LAS). Ashley said she pulled the records and that I basically was lying because all here records show otherwise as if Nordstrom\u2019s don\u2019t make mistakes. Well here is where they made a mistake hiring Ashley. Her customer service skill are terrible. She did not want to do further investigation and said basically Nordstrom does not embrace the CARES ACT. My credit was Ruined because of Nordstrom\u2019s lack of proper communication and the choice not to care about what the American people are going through during this COVID Pandemic. I wish I could cancel this card, but I know it would further ruin my credit. Therefore, I will use it as little as possible. I will never shop with them again it's such a sad case.

PLEASE READ.  I received a call from \"Daisy\" from TD Bank on a Monday in September, 2020, telling me that someone had completed an online application over the weekend and that the bank was suspicious of the activity because \"the information seemed off.\"  When I asked for more information, she provided nothing more.  When I confirmed that I had not submitted the application, she said, \"I will prevent the account from opening due to fraud and you should contact the credit bureaus about this.\"  I asked what number she could be reached and she said, \"There is only one Daisy in the fraud department and if you call back to ask for me, they will know who that is.\"  When I asked for the number, she said, \"Just look it up online.\"  Several days later, I received in the mail several packs of checkbooks from TD Bank with my name and address but the wrong phone number.  I called the number I found online for TD Bank and asked for \"Daisy.\"  The woman who answered the phone, \"Diamond,\" said she could not confirm if there was a Daisy who worked there and that I would need to speak with her.  I described that no account was supposed to be opened in my name since I did not apply for it and that I wanted to speak with Daisy since she was familiar with the situation.  Diamond refused to transfer me and after asking the account number for the checks, she said, \u201cI have taken care of the problem and nothing further needs to be done.\u201d  I told her, \u201cwith respect, I cannot simply take your word for that\u201d and asked to speak with her supervisor for more information as I was very worried about the fact that someone had committed identity theft with the bank and that the bank had not prevented the account from opening as promised.  For several minutes, she argued with me, telling me she could not tell me who her supervisor was before finally telling me his name was Victor \u2026 but he was not in.  I asked who the bank president was and for several minutes, she simply ignored the question and would not answer.  It was truly bizarre!  She finally told me the bank president for TD Bank is named Greg.  When I asked for his last name, Diamond said, \u201cWe cannot give out last names.\u201d  What??  TD Bank has a policy of not giving the last name of their bank president?  No.  Simply no.  That cannot be.  PLEASE avoid using this bank at all costs.

I've been a loyal Nordstrom customer for nearly half my life, and have always appreciated the high level of customer service I've received. I typically never open retail credit cards because my other cards offer such superior benefits, but I finally gave in recently and opened a Nordstrom retail card. The first month after I opened the card, I paid online using my checking account. I have had this checking account since I was 16 years old and have had the same account number the whole time. So when I received a call from Nordstrom saying I hadn't paid my bill, I was shocked. I had submitted payment for my entire balance. The customer service agent informed me that my payment had been returned because the account number was incorrect. First, I was confused that the payment system showed that I had submitted payment if the number was wrong; I was also frustrated that I had not been notified of that right away, and now they were trying to charge me a return fee. While on the phone, I logged into my Nordstrom account and verified that the account number is indeed correct. I asked to have the return fee reversed, which they did, and asked her to run the payment again. It went through. This exact same thing then happened the next two months. I did not change my account number at any point, yet they kept saying my account \"was not found\". As someone with a fairly long and robust credit history, I was baffled that it was so difficult to pay them. I have never had a company make it so difficult to pay them. (I have also never had any issues paying my credit card balance from my checking account.)Already wondering if I had made the right decision in opening this retail card, I gave it another go several months later for Anniversary Sale. My fiance needed a new wardrobe and we both wanted to purchase a few things for wedding activities. The total was significantly more than I had charged to the card previously, and I paid it off in full at the end of the month, just like I had for every other month that I used the card. I tried to use my card again a few days later for an online purchase and I got another error. I called into customer support and was informed that because I submitted such a large payment compared to my first few months, they had placed a TWO WEEK hold on the payment, which has already been deducted (not pending, fully deducted) from my checking account. I would understand 2-3 business days for the transaction to clear, but two weeks is unacceptable, especially since I explained that my payment history actually is very consistent with this, because I always pay my full balance at the end of the month. I simply hadn't purchased very many things the first few months so the balance was relatively low. I feel there is little to no incentive to shop\/spend money\/use the retail card. I'm  really quite disappointed to have to leave such a poor review, but at this point I am questioning why I even opened this account and will likely go back to using my Capital One or Sapphire Preferred cards moving forward."},{"date":"2021-05-29","name":"ashimkb","user_id":"ashimkb","verified":false,"product":null,"review_comment":true,"stars":0,"review":"I am not shocked!!

I live in Oregon and, to my knowledge, there are no branches west of the Boston to Miami corridor.

There's absolutely no reason to take my Target card out of town for work so that meant I wasn't able to make a payment. Yes both occasions I was out of town on the due date.

And they do NOT follow the practice of some other store credit cards where you can go into the store and make a payment with your name and other identifying info. It's like they want you to miss your payment. Today was the last straw. They refused to waive a $28 late fee on a $40 balance so I called to cancel my account. After explaining all of this to some foreign lady she asked me why I wanted to close my account LOL. Just because she sounded different shouldn't mean her brain works different. She waved the late fee last time but not this time. She couldn't close the account so she had to send me to another department. I explained the same scenario and told her the headache isn't worth it. Despite having $8K on my credit cards with $17K in total credit lines, Wells Fargo just approved me for a propel American Express with a $3,500 credit line so obviously I don't need this Target card.

We love their no-fee credit card, their flat monthly fee, and their very friendly tellers. HOWEVER; the whole reason I felt the need to write this review is because of what I have seen happen to people close to me, and how utterly appalling I think it is.The majority of frauds and scams are (or at least used to be) based on checks. People will deposit these checks at TD bank, send some of the money back to the scammer, and supposedly keep the rest. These can be in the amounts of hundreds all the way up to millions and most people CANNOT absorb this loss. TD will tell you after the fact that the check did not clear and the money never existed.WHY on earth are they putting money in your account (the amount on the check) and allowing people to withdraw or spend it when it was never real and never belonged to the person in question?? People trust their banks and I can't tell you how big the sense of betrayal is when they are suddenly demanding the person \"return the money to them,\" all while blaming the victims 100% no matter how they were defrauded, and sitting there with a lawyer who is telling you what will happen if you don't pay them back.I fear this issue is deep and far reaching in the financial industry. But until TD starts taking responsibility for THEIR contribution to fraud; giving people money that isn't real. There is no reason whatsoever to do this. Simply wait until the money is confirmed. The second way they contribute to fraud is when someone is fraudulently taking money from your account, doing it without permission, etc, YOU, the customer are told you need to pay a regular monthly fee for each person\/corporation you want to block from charging your account. How can they tell people, when they are the ones being paid to protect and securely store your money, that we must pay every month to stop someone from stealing that money, for as long as they are trying to do it? Once again, all the responsibility is put on someone else for something that is a part of their job. if TD fixed these issues I would be giving at least a 4 star rating, but it hurts my heart that anyone would go to such lengths to avoid accountability and cause further harm to victims of crime."},{"date":"2020-06-01","name":"Jay Jay","user_id":"hanthonybunu","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Prepaid Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"I recommend no one to get this bank.

They agreed to remove the charge, but it never came off the account. A month later, I paid the remaining balance to close the account, less the $27.00 that was to be removed. Fast forward several months and it was never removed, and they continue to add chargers upon charges. TD Bank will never see another penny of my money, I do not care how long this sits in collections. After calling and speaking to several different people, including two supposed managers, they still refuse to remove these amount.

This was extremely stressful, so I just said \"yes\" to everything to get out of the situation and put the charges on my USAA Visa card instead.  I also have an 830 credit score, no debt, and solid financial situation, so I found all this highly unusual.  Two weeks later I received the plastic card in the mail and was barred from activating it due to a hold on the account.  So I called customer service to at least pay off the initial $1000 balance to prevent interest and fees.  I did an electronic funds transfer from my bank to do so, but was told if I return any items there may be problems putting the refund $ back on the card -- I may need to take store credit instead.  I don't want store credit if I return items -- I want cash, but I checked the back of the receipts and this is actually the contract for returns: credit back on the tender used for payment or store credit.

Target \"National Bank\" is a cancer on the Target brand name and needs to be abolished.  It's much more harsh, impersonal, inflexible, and conservative than any of the huge national bank conglomerates.  They don't care about their customers and are all about making a buck off your back.  (1) Target \"pushes\" this credit card through it's employees at point-of-sale and they resent being harassessed for not \"selling\" enough cards.  Check the online blogs including at 'ihatetarget.com'.  (2) Customers are being pushed into applying for this card at point-of-sale and tempted with immediate 'savings' on their purchase.  Standing at a cash register with people lined up behind you is not the time to be deciding if you want to apply for a credit card and the implications of that!!  (3) I applied at the register for my 5% savings but the application would not allow me to list my (correct) PO Box since I travel for business and don't want my mail sitting curbside for days.  I had to list my street address (which only gets junk mail.)   My first mistake, I admit.  I should not even have applied but they put me on the spot.  (4) My bill got mixed in with other mail and I missed making my payment.  Yes, my mistake, but an honest mistake.  As soon as I became aware of it, I paid the amount in full, not just the minimum due. (5) Due to the honest misunderstanding, I asked to have late charges and\/or interest credited to my account as a one-time courtesy, since I don't make a habit of being an irresponsible borrower.  They refused.  They reported me 30-days late on my payment to credit bureau.(6) I used the card more over a period of a couple of years to show I was responsible.  (7) After a few years, I asked them to give me a good faith removal of that 30-day late payment.  They refused.  I asked again after several months, by elevating to a higher level (VP).  They refused.  *Note:  Statistics show the majority of customers who ask for a reversal of late charges, interest, or dropping of late payment reports succeed, especially on the first offense.  Most stores know people are human, they sometimes make mistakes, and they shouldn't be beat over the head for a late payment for the SEVEN YEARS it takes to fall off their credit reports.  Not Target.  They will take every opportunity to make every penny they can off every customer from interest and fees to make up for that 5% they pay out.  Not good for business or for customer relations, but they don't care about you.  It's all about the almighty dollar with them.  (8)  I proceeded to boycott Target fpr several years. They threatened to close my card from disuse and finally closed it.  I'm coming up on the end of my seven-year late payment sentence.  It really doesn't affect my credit much at this point, but it annoys me that they continue to hold it over me.

First of all the annoying things that make it an inconvenient bank, but don't make you want to go through the trouble of closing your accounts. Almost every day the ATMs are out of order around NYC. The mobile app rarely works outside of banking hours. Customer service wait times are very long, and once you reach an agent the hoops you have to jump through to prove it's your account are incredible. They have a policy that transactions are handled in time order, so if I have a recurring payment that goes through a day early, which happens often, and I see that it's unexpectedly pending, and deposit money to cover it before it posts, I am still charged an overdraft fee. I hate all those things about TD Bank, but today I had an experience that set me over the edge and I am definitely closing my account as soon as my check is cleared. I deposited my paycheck from work on Friday after the cutoff time, so it's usually available to me on Monday when that happens, but this time it wasn't. I assumed it would be available on Tuesday because another annoying thing is that they're inconsistent about whether Saturday deposits will be available on Monday or Tuesday. I had no reason not to believe it would be available Tuesday as per usual, but Tuesday morning it was still on hold with a code that said something like FM Hold - See SM. I was told this meant see secure messages. No messages. I called customer service to ask about it and the agent just gave me a bunch of nonsense read from a script and couldn't explain anything to me so I asked for a manager. The manager told me it was just a random hold that they do sometimes and even though I have been depositing checks in this amount from this employer since I opened the account two years ago they flagged it for verification, and I can expect this to happen at any time in the future. I asked why I wasn't sent a message to notify me that the deposit wouldn't be available when it usually is and she said it isn't their policy to notify customers about extended holds because they don't have the manpower. I think that is incredibly bad customer service. I had scheduled payments to the IRS and my credit card company to go through on the day I expected my deposit to be available, so I had to take time away from work to withdraw money from my savings and deposit it into my checking account to make sure my payments cleared so I wouldn't be in trouble with the IRS and get charged overdraft fees. The manager told me that in the future I can check with the bank manager of the branch where I make my deposits every time I make a deposit to find out if there will be an extended hold. She seemed to think this was a reasonable thing to expect. The whole situation is just so abusive to the customer. I feel taken advantage of. I feel powerless to control my own finances, and each of the people I talked to clearly didn't care and basically just said oh well, not my problem, deal with it. I'm not a deadbeat customer either. I have a very high credit score because I pay all my bills early, I keep money in the bank, I don't cause problems or have unreasonable expectations. There's no reason they shouldn't treat me like a valued customer. My expectation that they should notify the customer ahead of time if a check will have an extended hold time is not unreasonable at all considering it's a checking account and the main reason to have a checking account is to pay bills, but apparently they don't think their customers deserve this courtesy. I really hope they go out of business because they definitely deserve it."},{"date":"2018-10-04","name":"underwoodadrienne","user_id":"underwoodadrienne","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"TD Bank has the worst customer service and efficiency I have ever encountered.

When I first opened an account, I didn't really understand the overdraft fees, I thought if I put money in the account before the end of the day then I wouldn't get charged overdraft fees but it took two different phone calls for them to finally notify me that their bank is point of service and they'll allow you a few overdrafts a day before declining your card, a service a somehow have ok fine. That's not even why I'm so upset today. So I had gave my landlord a check and asked him not to put it in until the 9th, I even dated it the 9th thinking I was protecting myself. He said it was fine. Somehow I think we had some kind of miscommunication because he cashed it the same day. Me not knowing he did this I was swiping for coffee and diapers basic essentials, thinking I had money in there. I went to pump gas 6 or 7 days later and my card was declined. I told my husband that can't be we had almost $800.00 in there. Well we look at our acct we see that the $1200 check had cleared even though  we had insufficient funds. To make matters worse my husband's check went it and td bank had took it because supposedly  we were negative $900.00. Because of a check that was not suppose to go through. I called customer service extremely hysterical. I explained to them we work paycheck to paycheck,  this is how we feed our 4 kids. That check was not suppose to go through, we dated it the 9th. We're being charged so many overdraft fees and  we didn't even know we were overdrafted. The guy went on to explain that banks no longer do post dated checks so whenever I handed over the check the person I gave it to has the right to cash it, he even have me an attitude for not knowing this. This is something new to me. I explained that to him, I pleaded with him to help us, as our bank please be on the customer side. This is how we feed our kids, pay our bills. We honestly didn't know you couldn't post date checks anymore. He said all he could do is return $35.00. 35 out of almost $800.00. I asked to speak to his manager in a panic and all she could do for me was give me back another 110.00.  For some unknown reason she said we didn't qualify for a full refund. I can't believe that a bank that claims to be all for family, couldn't help this family. I understand that I need to be more aware of policies and I now know more then I did. But I can't believe for not knowing the new policies about posted checks my family is out almost $800.00. I can't believe I only qualified for 140 back. My family is suffering about this and we did not have the support of our bank when  we needed it.

Or should I say, loved.  I have been using the debit rewards program for a few years.  A month ago I was checking out and offered a credit card and so I applied.  I was offered a 5K limit.  This was verbally stated.  I then received the card in the mail with a paper that verified this credit limit.  After using the card for a few weeks earning points to shop in their stores, i.e. using it at the market and for gas, I created an online account.  The account status also verified the credit limit.In six weeks I used almost all of the available credit.  And they did not like that.  They decided to rescind their agreement and without communicating any change occurred they simply cut the credit limit in half which immediately put my account in an over limit status.  They said the limit I was given was a clerical error.  Which is a flat out lie.In my experience businesses who respect their customer or need their customer to return will put their foot where their mouth is.  If they say the fare is $100 and it was a clerical error, they honor it.  But not Nordstrom.   When I make an agreement with someone or something, it means I will keep my word.  And quite frankly, if I do not, the bank would hold me to it until I do.  There is no path for me to force them to keep their word. Therefore this is not a mutual business relationship but a one sided taker relationship.  As far as I understand economics, the 18-22% interest is the risk payoff that they earn to keep their part in this relationship.Presently, there is a manufacturer who is producing a sofa because they thought I had money to order it.  So did I.  Nordstrom decided not to honor their word and they have rescinded the charge a month after it was previously approved.  Since I am a woman of my word, I'm going to have to scramble to pay this manufacturer.I will pay the Nordstrom card off in one lump sum and cut it up never to use their banking or reward system again.  I won't give takers who do not respect their customer my business.  They need to understand that if not for the consumer, they would not exist.

However, please keep in mind how hard you will be working for that 5%, and how inconsistently you'll be receiving it.I have had numerous issues with the card due to various technicalities on my account.  It has taken me an average of 5 phone calls per issue to their customer service account in order to resolve anything.  Yes, that's the AVERAGE number of times I've had to call.  You will definitely be on hold, the first person will definitely not be able to help you, if they can even access your account, and there's somewhere between a 25% and 45% chance that the call will end abruptly when their servicer hangs up on you.Specifically, they have an extraordinarily difficult time receiving direct payments from my bank, which is a major international bank, not some small obscure credit union no one has ever heard of, which has resulted in payments not posting and me being charged interest and fees even though my initial attempts at payment have been well before the payment deadlines.  I know this because they opened my account at a pathetically small credit limit, so I have to pay it off multiple times a month in order to keep the card operating.  The worst part about that is when I call them to request a change to the limit, they direct me back to website where there's a one-box submit form where you update your annual income.  As far as I know, I might as well be writing my annual income down on a piece of paper and throwing that paper directly into the garbage rather than wasting my increasingly limited amount of hope that some human somewhere is actually going to receive the request.So, I'm going back to paper statements, paper checks, and the acceptance that the 5% at the register discount will work probably no more than half the time I'm there.  So, go ahead and get the card, just be sure to have your back-up ready, because you can bet they won't bother contacting you if there are any issues such that your card isn't going to work."},{"date":"2017-02-28","name":"Joaquin Rivera","user_id":"joaquinr2","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I just applied for the target red card and I just love it I was approved for 300 dollars 650 EQ score so far very happy"},{"date":"2020-07-29","name":"Diane  Wishart","user_id":"LadyDi","verified":false,"product":null,"review_comment":true,"stars":0,"review":"I've had the Target card for over 20 years and received one increase within the first five years.

This is only the latest example. I am forced to make my business's deposits by mail because 1) the closest branch to me is >3 hrs away since I moved, and 2) their mobile deposit ceiling is only $5k, which I can't imagine works for most businesses and certainly not mine. I sent a large check to their deposit by mail facility in Lewiston ME on Wednesday, and according to USPS tracking TDBank picked it up yesterday (Friday) at 7 am. By afternoon it was still not showing in my account. I called before 4 pm to ask why. All I got from the first CS and his supervisor was \"We have no way to check that.\" They didn't even know how to contact the bank by mail division. On the 2nd escalation, to Anthony on the \"Leadership Team\" in Maine, I finally learned that bank by mail deposits are processed overnight, so it wasn't unusual that it wasn't showing up in my account. By that time, it was past 5 and there was no way to call that department and verify the check was actually there & not lost, but Anthony assured me I'd see the deposit in my account by this morning. I had been on the phone with TDBank CS for almost 2 hours at that point. Well, overnight is now over and I still have no deposit. So that excuse is now gone. 3 weeks prior to this, I'd mailed a separate large deposit to TDBank's Morganton, NC branch. They lost that one. This is a total of over $55k in deposits lost by TDBank in 3 weeks. I don't even know what to do at this point. I am not spending another hour or multiple hours dealing with their customer service line and the people there who don't even know how the bank works. Processing deposits is one of the most basic, essential functions any bank makes. How on earth can they not get this right, and who do I have to speak with to get this straightened out??? This isn't something I should have to worry about for so much as a second, and yet I do. Apparently I have no way of being sure that a mailed deposit will actually make it into my account.

I was with them as a customer from roughly 2001 through 2012.  I found the bank to be less than satisfactory.  To begin with, as a student (which I was until 2008) I apparently was entitled to completely free checking with no overdraft fees or any other fees.  It was only after TD Bank had charged me over $1200 in fees over a 6 year period did I find out this little known tidbit.  When I inquired about a refund or credit for all the fees I accrued but should not have been charged for they told me it was my fault that I didn't know about the student checking.  I then proceeded to pull all my money from TD Bank as I found another bank that was more to my liking.  Nearly 2 years after I \"closed\" my account, I got a bill from a bill collector saying that I owed TD Bank $345 in fees due to not having the minimum balance in my account.  It became obvious very quickly to me that the representative that had \"closed\" my account in fact never \"closed\" it but actually left it open for nearly 2 years after I had removed all the money.  Would not bank with TD again.

I usually go to the same branch (94th Street and Broadway, NY,NY) know pretty much all of the tellers there. When we run into each other on the street they even say hello! If I have questions about my accounts or notices I have received in the mail, I bring them in and they have no problem with explaining them to me very clearly. I've never been surprised by any hidden fees because it's always clearly noted either on the notices, app, emails, or in person by the teller. TD has great communication with its customers.They're also family friendly (which isn't so important for a bank, but it is nice). Whenever I have to bring my little sister, they give her TD packaged crayons and coloring pages. You also can't beat the free lollipops. The dog biscuits and water bowls are a cute idea too.

The fees are also rather high, and they always re-order the transactions hoping that you will overdraw and that it will result in more fees (for example, if on Monday you make 4 small debit card transactions for which you have the money, and on Wednesday a check is drawn against your account for $800-even if you have $799 in your account they will put the largest transaction through first-so then all 4 small debit card transactions are considered overdrafts and incur large fees-it doesn't matter which order you perform the transactions in). However, if you are mindful of the balance this shouldn't be a problem.

The only way I would suggest you get this card is if you are very disciplined in paying off your balance as soon as you make a purchase with it.  In other words, go straight to the service desk and pay the balance immediately.  That way you will never be charged that rate of interest which would completely wipe out any savings you may have received. Also, if you carry a balance on this card, and if you accidentally are 7 days late on your payment, they start treating your account as if it is in collection, sending nasty emails to you that \"this is an attempt to collect a debt and any information...\"   It doesn't matter how many years you have had the card and have made payments on time.

Typically, I feel, they are designed to rip you off.  And generally this is correct.  However, the Target Red Card credit card breaks the mold, and if you are the sort of person who pays your card in full at the end of the month, then you need to have this card.  It will save you all kinds of money.  The first benefit is the 5% off every purchase.  I love this, it's great, sign me up.  Right?  Absolutely!  5% adds up!  But personally I love this card because I can get unlimited free shipping on any order.  I no longer have to search around for deals, trying to get to the $25 that will entitle me to free shipping.  So if I want to order one tee-shirt (for example) for $7, it's 5% off and free shipping.  I love that!  Also, returns are super easy, I just waltz into Target and hand it off.  Done.  I don't care about their data breach, it never affected me, and anyway they did make good on that.  I wish other stores would take their lead and off the substantial rewards that Target does.  Walmart, are you reading this??  5 stars everyone.  Now the disclaimer ***I don't even know what the interest rate is, and I don't care because I pay my card off in full each month****  If you do NOT pay it each month, please do your due diligence on the interest rate, because those things will kill your finances.

The reason is simple; it saves me money in the form of a) 5% off on each and every purchase, either online or in store and b) free shipping on every order, no matter how large or small.  Typically my orders are small and would not qualify for free shipping so now that I have the card I can pick up whatever I want and have it shipped for free.  I pay the balance in full every month and cannot speak to the interest rate; my recommendation is pay your bills in full every month, or don't use your credit cards.

THEN charged another $70.00 in fees for being a negative $2.00 after charging $162.00 for debits that she thought were coming from her paycheck.  THIS IS INSANE!!!!!! I didn't believe her till I saw the statement. So with her we called the customer service number and the woman that answered was HORRENDOUS. When she or I would ask a question the rep would continuously and without stopping recite a page of whatever fee agreement clause and when would try to ask another question she would just repeat it louder and louder and NEVER listen to a question.  When I got on the phone and asked her for another rep she repeated the same recitation AGAIN. I began asking her over and over for another representative and she wouldn't stop reciting the same script.

At 5% cash back on all Target purchases it far outpaces the other cards on the market without an annual fee. Cards like the Citi Double Cash (2% back) and Capital One Quicksilver (1.5%) are near the top in terms of rewards, yet don't come close to 5%. However, I would highly recommend this not being your primary card, because it offers no rewards whatsoever on any purchases outside of Target. The added bonuses of increasing the return date by 30 days as well as free shipping at Target.com also sweeten the rewards provided by this card.People must also be aware that it will not work oversees.Bottom Line:It is a great card for the avid Target shopper, but if you rarely shop at Target there are other cards out there that offer better overall shopping rewards."},{"date":"2015-02-09","name":"Alina Rossi","user_id":"arossi2424","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I had an excellent customer service experience with TD Bank.

My first year I earned almost $200 in cash rewards, which was a breeze to redeem. I have had one other cash reward credit card from a well known company, and I chose to cancel my account with them because of how confusing it was. The only caveat is to make sure you don't have any late payment fees, as they can get quite hefty.

If I am dealing with a representative that doesn't necessarily know the answer to a question they quickly get me to someone who can help me.

The Target Store card fits this requirement for me. This cart offers 5% off every purchase and free shipping when using it for online purchases.What is really smart is to pair up these incentives with CartWheel discounts and coupons. Then the savings goes through the roof.  So if you are diligent and self-disciplined it is really worth your while to use this card for all Target purchases. The thing  you need to remember and why I mentioned being self-disciplined is that you need to pay it off each month to avoid the high interest rates. Most, if not all store credit cards have the high interest rates like Kohls or Sears. The difference is that they do not offer these amazing incentives to use their card. We really got ourselves in a pinch using our Sears card for making large purchases. There were no incentives and we paid very high interest rates. In a financial point of view it just makes sense to use the Target Store card and pay it off every month. Another point to make is that  you can find almost anything at Target. Groceries, household goods, toys, clothing etc. With their prices being reasonable to begin with I really don't think you can go wrong unless you don't pay it off in a monthly manner. If you don't then the discounts really cancel each other out with the 22.9% interest rate."},{"date":"2014-10-16","name":"Ashley Louks","user_id":"ashley.louks","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"Perhaps my review is influenced by my store experiences but the Nordstrom card is hands down my favorite.

The online account site is easy to use and the rewards are easily accrued, especially during their extra points events.

I have always loved the hours and that it is open seven days a week - it really is the most convenient bank. It is the only bank I can also find in Canada and use their ATM free of charge. The Penny Arcade has always been one of my favorite things about TD. Who doesn't have change and want to cash it in for no cost whatsoever (if you are a banker with them)? The customer service is always spectacular even when there is a long line (which they cannot control). The only thing that has gotten worse with the bank is the new fees they are beginning to charge - raising the ATM fee from nothing to $2 to $3 in a two or three year period. Hopefully they don't start adding more fees or I might have to start thinking about switching to an online bank.

Even if I lose my bank card I know I can go in, they will see me immediately, and print out a brand-new card for me right there. Super convenient hours and I am very happy with them in general.The one thing that does bother me, and this is half my fault, is their overdraft policies. Now, when I first started banking with TD I never had these issues before (they obviously had a different overdraft system in place) but it seems like all of a sudden, in the last year or so, I'm getting hit with overdrafts left and right for charges because of the way they will charge debits before credits.

The wording seems to go on and on and talk in circles so I had to have someone sit down with me and go over every bit of it which was very time consuming. Other than that they are the nicest people they remember our names and they remember my kids and they even give me a dog treat to take for my dog.

I chose them, because I've held a checking account with them ever since they acquired Hudson United Bank. They also offered a discount of, I think, 0.25% or 0.5% when you sign up for automatic payments from your TD checking account. I took out the loan to consolidate credit debt and improve my credit score. Which was good, because I ended up taking out a mortgage for a co-op purchase less than a year later. I didn't take the mortgage out from them, though. They don't do mortgages for co-ops where I live, or at least that was what they told me. Anyway, that loan is not what this review is about. The personal loan was easy to take out. Approval was timely and service was fairly decent. Not the best, but probably better than average. Everything was explained to me and any questions I had, the best I can recall, where answered adequately. To date, with both the personal loan and my checking account, I do not believe there is much to complain about. They did do away with their third party ATM fee reimbursement program some years ago, and that is something that should be held against them when considering how well banks are supposedly doing in this economy, but at least they aren't like some other banks who I shall not name here. All things considered, I will likely take out another loan from them if I ever need to do so in the future."},{"date":"2014-03-04","name":"Jane M.","user_id":"J.Miller","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I have had this card for awhile now and am overall satisfied.

That's definitely peace of mind for a mom!  Taking care of the balance and payments could not have been easier.  The online site is very easy to use, but very secure.  You can also make payments at any Target store's customer service counter.  I never had a single problem with this card and found their customer service to be top-notch every single time I needed them.  The only caution I would give anyone is that the percentage rate is pretty high, so make sure you are able to pay it off each month, rather than let it go over into monthly payments.

A huge perk to me is the complimentary alterations. I am very small and am often finding myself having to make alterations on clothing so that they fit me properly.

I go into my bank maybe once a week, but it seems like almost all the tellers have come to recognize my face and know be my name.  I like that feeling when going into a bank and they for sure provide it.  One issue I have with TD Bank is the ridiculous fees on checking and overdrafts.  They charge $35 per overdraft, $10 more than any other bank I have ever worked with.  They also have a fee every month on any checking account that doesn't have a minimum balance.  I think that is kind of ridiculous to say the least.  Another problem I had was when an International wire came in they were not able to tell me how the exchange rate was calculated or what the rate was that date.

I just wanted to keep an account that was liquid and allowed me fast access in case of an emergency (my car breaks down, etc...).I started the application for the savings account online, but because I had recently made an address change, it needed to be completed over the phone.  I called TD Bank's customer service line and was on the phone with a representative in minutes.  Imagine that!  I didn't have to wait for a half hour!  The very friendly representative had me set up with FREE savings account in a matter of minutes that was associated with my FREE checking account.  The requirements were very minimal and easily met my needs. In a nutshell, TD Bank is one of the few financial institutions that still seem to cater to a person as an individual rather than as a number.  From their AMAZING hours (7 days a week!) to the fact they have dog biscuits at the drive through window for your canine companions, they really take customer service to an entirely new level."},{"date":"2013-11-22","name":"Amanda Villano","user_id":"lalian","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"TD Bank has been my bank for about a year. The checking account options are very varied, and all a little cheaper than the competition - that's why I chose them! As a recent college grad, I knew that I wouldn't be able to afford high monthly fees for an account, nor a high monthly minimum balance that many other bank companies required. So, after doing research I decided on TD bank. I was able to easily set up my entire account online, at home. When I did run into some slight problems creating my online checking account, customer service was fast and helpful. They set things up for me in a short period of time and explained anything I didn't understand. After my first check took awhile to clear, they even waived the monthly fee for my balance dropping below $100.

However, you definitely want to watch your balance because it has a high interest rate of 22.9%.

One of of the things that I do not understand about banks is that most of them are only open during the business day which is a problem because most people are working during their regular business hours.  I like TD Bank because they are open before and after my \"9-5\" job as well as on Saturdays and Sundays which is really awesome.

I left BOA for TD because they had ATM fees and it would cost me upwards of $5 to take money out because of the fee at the ATM itself, then the additional non BOA fee. Now TD has the same thing so i'm very displeased with this, especially since they do not have a lot of locations around where I spend my time and money. Doesn't make sense to leave now since its the same as every other bank. Just don't agree much with the \"most convenient bank\" slogan.

The problems I have with it are probably similar to most large national banks. First of all, I have a $14 monthly fee for keeping a checking account open. This seems ridiculous to me when other banks and credit unions charge nothing. And there have been times that I've over-drafted because of slow pending charges (my fault, most likely, but still...) and been charged $35 per transaction after the overdraft. If I were to use my debit card several times, even for very small purchases, on a day when I hadn't noticed my account had overdrafted, I could rack up $200 in fees quite quickly, with no sort of forgiveness or reimbursement from TDbank (believe me, I've tried!)."},{"date":"2013-10-31","name":"Joshua","user_id":"diplox","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I've been with TD Bank for several years now.

They have a nice discount that you get right away off your purchases at the register. The card is relatively easy to attain, we've had ours for awhile and it was before we had much of a credit history. It is very easy to manage your Target card online and make payments or check your balance there. Applying for the card online is a very simple process as well. The interest rate is the one thing about this card that I don't care for much (it is 23%) but it's still a useful card, especially considering how many different items one can purchase at Target.

I currently do have a savings account still with them, but I haven't been 100% happy with them. For starters, their customer service is horrible. Whether I try to get in touch with someone on the phone, or go there in person, It's always a hassle. No matter what branch I go to, the lines are always ridiculous, probably due to the popularity. However, there has never been a serious issue with my money being in a savings account with them, and they do offer me a students savings which is extremely convenient for me. They do what they are supposed to do, the only main problem is hoping that I never have an issue because It's impossible getting in touch with anyone there.

They also offer it to people that might not have the best credit, which you don't see much these days. Another great feature is that there are zero fees and no point systems that will confuse you.

The grace period is a so-so, iffy 25 days on purchases before interest is charged, and the interest rate is a relatively high 22.9% APR.

This is especially annoying when I try to go the bank after work or on my lunch break, but thankfully they are open late so I can at least get my banking done by the end of the day.  My other issue is the ATM fee.  If I don't use a TD ATM, not only am I charged the ATM surcharge, but TD charges me a surcharge of I believe $3.00. It might be $2.00, but I've avoided non-TD ATMs like the plague for the past 3 years.  Regardless, it make an ATM transaction $3.50-$5.00 on top of what I am taking out.

The idea about having the points is the same, although GAP gives points for every $50 you spend.  The negative aspects about both the Nodstrom card and the GAP card are that if you have bad credit or if you make a late payment, you will have a very high interest rate.

However, as with any store card, opening a new credit card lowered my credit rating.

While \"fiscally responsible\" and \"credit card\" may not always go in the same sentence, I must say that I'm very happy with my Target card. It basically eliminates tax where I live, by reducing 5% off all purchases. This was incredibly appealing when we first moved in to our house, as we were buying more expensive things, such as entertainment units, dressers, etc. It's also nice when shopping for groceries, because it allows you to splurge just a little bit and get that ice cream or bag of potato chips. I'd assume that it's nice to have on electronics purchases as well, but I haven't actually done much big electronics purchasing, yet.

The process of opening the card is simple, it was done right at the register with a driver's license.  I have used the RED card several times to make purchases online at Target.com and gotten free shipping for using the credit card.  Of note:  the interest rate on the Target credit card is high, I believe north of 20 percent, so if you carry a balance, this is likely not the card for you.

The APR is slightly high but most store cards are this rate or even higher, so over all it\u2019s not a bad deal.

After learning about the 5% off every purchase, I decided I'd take a few minutes out of my trip to apply for one and was approved. I shop at Target at least 3 times weekly and this has saved me a lot on my purchases. I haven't had any problems paying it off but then again I try not to carry a large balance on it as it has a semi-high interest rate for a store card but it will save you in the long run if you are a weekly Target shopper like myself. It's also helpful because Target seems to have every item imaginable so therefore you can save 5% on mostly everything.

It was the one card that I never had any issues with paying the bill because the fees were not completely outrageous every month. I loved that it could be used on anything in the store and that you always get 5% back on your purchases. I would mostly use it for home goods and little extras I might not normally buy, but if there was ever a week I needed a little help with groceries, it was nice to have it available as a back-up.

I only opened a basic checking account because I was moving to the other side of the country and didn't want to carry a couple thousand dollars in cash. It took about 20 minutes, tops, to get my checking account in order and the people at the branch could not have been nicer. There was no minimum balance, no fees of any kind and the best part is, that if some entity tries to take money out of our account\u2026 (let's say, an identity theft court settlement that you had no idea about) they won't release your money. They call you, have you close your account, give you your cash and then let you battle it out with whomever. Wachovia let a fraudulent company completely clean out my bank account and screwed me financially for the next 7-10 years. Anyways, using my TD card cross country was excellent, I had no problem checking in from all over the US to keep an eye on my account. And, sadly, when it was time to close my TD bank account because I had reached my destination, I was able to do it very easily over the phone. They even mailed me a check for the .37 that was left.

An additional change is that you need to enter payments one at a time where prior I could enter multiple payments for different Payees at one time. Now with the new method you enter each Payee separately and there is an addition screen before you approve payment to add any notes.

When I tried to resolve this with customer service, they were completely unhelpful. They couldn't do anything for me over the phone, kept me on hold for close to 10 minutes at a time, and when I demanded they refund the money to my account said they couldn't do that until the investigation by their fraud officer was complete. Their bank branch wasn't open because it was Easter. And as I was flying out of the state before they opened on Monday, I'm going to now have to wait a week before I can resolve this issue ,because they refuse to take reports or help customers over the phone. It's like being robbed a second time.

It may seem small, but the comfortable furnishings and trendy decor was inviting. The one issue I had was the waiting time. I waited for around 45 minutes in order to be helped. However, after sitting with them, it was easy to understand why. They take so much time, and dedicate it only to you during your sit down, that they make you feel wanted and welcome. They do not intimidate, scare or shame like at other banks. They are real people and they are there to help other real people. I have had some issues with a stolen ID in the past and since the person tried to go in to that particular branch, they knew it was not me. They immediately called me, and since that person had also stolen money and other items from me, the police were able to get back some of my items. I cannot say enough great things about TD bank. The only sad thing, and the reason for 4 stars, is that they just do not have enough branches. I have since moved, and the closest one to me is a 15 minute drive. Too many times I have had to go to another bank to get cash and spend $7.00 in total after all the fees from both banks.

I actually moved to this company from KeyBank, because I was feeling like I wanted a smaller \u201catmosphere\u201d in order to deal with my financial needs, and at the time, Key was too corporate. Hence, I made the move to what was then TD Banknorth, and for a couple of years, I was extremely satisfied. Most of my problems were able to be handled in-house, with a friendly customer service representative, behind the privacy of a comfortable office. Being from a somewhat small town, this was something that made me feel good about the people holding onto my money, and I was happy to make the move. Recently, I have become more and more upset with TD Bank. I have found more hidden fees than I even knew possible. For example, I used an ATM the other day at a convenience market. Not only did the convenience market charge me $3.00 (which I knew about), but then the bank also charged me a NON TD ATM FEE of $2.50. This brought my balance down to $99.73 and under the new $100 minimum rule they were then able to charge me a $25 fee PER DAY. The tier keeps climbing, and those faithful customers who began such a greedy business just get poorer, and poorer. Now, when I went to the local branch to try and sort out this mess, I was greeted with a somewhat empathetic smile, and told that the only thing I could do was call the customer service number. So, when I called the customer service number they could hardly speak English and told me to try the local branch, otherwise, I could borrow money from someone to get my balance up. Unbelievable! I am extremely dissatisfied, and this is only one example explaining why."},{"date":"2013-02-22","name":"Simon Cook","user_id":"simeycook","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I have been a TD Bank customer for 16 years and opened a joint account with them when they were Commerce bank. My experiences with them have been mixed over the years.I like the fact that they are open on Sunday as it gives me the option to bank all week around if needed. I had no major complaints when they were Commerce Bank. Once a charge appeared on my account for several thousand dollars that was in error and they removed it within hours.When they became TD Bank and the banking industry started to look for new methods of gaining revenue I began to encounter problems. Firstly, they introduced a charge for using other banks\u2019 ATMs. Thus, while I had been used to getting free ATM withdrawals from my local Quick Check or Wawa, I was suddenly charged every time. I complained about this but basically was told that I had to find a TD Bank ATM. The nearest ATM is several miles away from my house. Therefore I opened a PNC Bank account and now only use TD Bank to pay bills.Overall, I am mostly satisfied with my experiences with TD Bank, however, as the industry begins to get more aggressive with revenue generation I suspect I may end up closing my account and transferring everything to PNC.

However, I think TD bank has some unclear disclosure issues - for example, I got a notice recently that my student checking account was about to start getting hit by a $15\/month fee if I didn't maintain a daily balance of $100 or more, and they sent this notification with less than two weeks until the date they planned to change my account type! I think their overdraw policies are also pretty unclear in terms of what they charge fees for and it appears to me, sometimes, to be enforced unevenly. The policy, as I understand it, is if you overdraw by less than $5, no big deal - but I\u2019ve gotten the $35 overdraw fee for a less than $5 withdraw and while the customer service representative at my bank was helpful in clearing it up, it necessitated a lot of stress and a trip to the bank that wasn\u2019t necessary."},{"date":"2012-11-26","name":"Tiffany Von Trapp","user_id":"tiffany_vontrapp1","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I have had an account with this bank for about six or seven years, dating all the way back to when it was Commerce Bank.

I was a TD Bank member for 5 years. I liked that in my city there were numerous locations, so it was very convenient if I needed money or needed to deposit. Convenience was one thing I was looking for when I was deciding which bank to open an account in. The other thing that caught my attention was their availability to their customers. They have hours at their branches that I\u2019ve never seen for a bank. They are even open on Sundays! I had no issues with their customer service, I had an issue with a check not getting cashed and obviously lost and they were very kind to stop the missing check and even waived the fee, because it was my first one. I was floored and thanked the service rep numerous times. Even the tellers at the bank cared about you as a person and made sure to greet you with a warm smile and send you on your way with sentiments. The only thing I didn't like with TD Bank is when they started charging fees for keeping my money with them, and switched what type of ATMs we could use without fees. I just don't like when a bank charges me for keeping my money. Other than that issue, I had no problems with TD and if you are looking for a bank that is convenient in the hours and location department, has friendly customer service representatives and tellers, then by all means I do recommend TD Bank!"},{"date":"2012-11-14","name":"Sin LnStyle","user_id":"sin_lnstyle","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":2,"review":"TD bank is ok. As far as convenience and locations go they are top notch. They are really everywhere. It seems though that TD enjoys changing their fine print on a regular basis. First we had issues when they charged a bunch of tiny items like gas and burgers onto the account ahead of the deposit check clearing. This resulted in like $300 worth of $35 overcharges over $10 worth of actual purchases, 30 seconds before $1000 worth of deposits were put in. Whatever\u2026 they fixed it and made it right and we never let that happen again. Then a new $15 charge if your account ever drops below $150. Now we just got a mail stating the $150 minimum will be changed to $250. On top of that the account we just opened a month ago for my teenage daughter will now require a minimum and that made no mention of it while we were there opening it for her.To many changes, we have had enough.

If at any point your balance drops below $100, you will be dinged with a monthly fee.  This is the case even if you have direct deposit set up with them.  Compare to: Bank of America, who have never charged me a fee as long as I've had direct deposits going to my account.The good?  Almost everything else.  Long hours of operation, even on the weekends.  This is the biggest plus for me, because I hate showing up to a bank branch only to find out it is closed.  Their bill pay is also excellent, I don't even have to send a rent check to my landlord anymore, they print one out and mail it for me!  Free coin counting is another plus.

I highly recommend TD Bank if you are looking for a bank that cares about their customers and has very convenient hour."},{"date":"2012-07-12","name":"Nikki Scott","user_id":"nikki.scott.1466","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"When I got the Target store card I only got it for emergency uses due to the fact that I had a new born baby and wanted to have a plan \u201cB\u201d in case something came up and I was not able to pay with cash for diapers, wipes and other things a newborn baby has to have.

Target uses Visa for their Credit Card provider.  When shopping at Target, I get 5% off my entire purchase.  Unfortunately, I use to get 10% off. Still, a discount is a discount.  When shopping online I get the 5% off as well,  plus free shipping to anywhere in the United States.  This is my primary credit card that I use for personal expenses and occasionally for business expenses.  When I am ready to pay my bill I can transfer money via my bank account or I can go to any target store and pay with cash or debit.  I usually pay at the store because it is only a block away.

I have a Student checking account and a Christmas savings account with them. I live in MA and go to their Auburn, Sturbridge and Worcester branches within the state. TD Bank has great, very convenient hours. They are open 7 days a week, opening early and staying open late. Their tellers and customer services representatives are always polite, efficient, and friendly. I recently had an incident where I overdrew my account four times in the same time period. It was an honest mistake on my part. I went to their Auburn branch and immediately was able to sit with a customer service representative. Within five minutes, I was leaving the bank with the fees reversed, and I was very happy and impressed. I would recommend TD Bank to anyone looking for a convenient, caring bank."},{"date":"2012-07-09","name":"Alex Weis","user_id":"aweis","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I normally visit the TD Bank branch just north of Bryant Park in Manhattan on 42nd Street and I am usually very happy with the customer service that the representatives provide. I usually go during lunch and, when there is a line, it usually moves very quickly. What also makes them unique is that some of their branches are open on Sundays. I would note that the bank seems to be growing its presence in the New York region, so even though Chase and Citibank dominate the scene, I imagine that several years from now TD Bank will have enough branches and ATM locations to make themselves even more convenient."},{"date":"2012-07-09","name":"Tim","user_id":"tbh8644","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I recently relocated to South Carolina from New Jersey where I was a customer of USAA. While I was big fan of the great customer service USAA provided, there weren't enough branches locally so I began doing my research. Friend after friend suggested TD Bank so I decided to take the leap and I'm glad I did. From the second I signed up I appreciated the genuine positive attitude of the bankers and have already used their online customer service module. Some banks are still behind the times when it comes to online banking but TD seems to be one step ahead which is important with me. Not only that but I recently got a smart phone and downloaded their online banking app. It allows you to basically do anything revolving around your account except for taking money out of the atm machine. If you're looking to change banks or just looking for your first I would strongly encourage you to try out TD Bank. From the service you get online to the service inside a branch, it's all there."},{"date":"2012-07-02","name":"Jennifer Zarichnyj","user_id":"jdahmer","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I have never had any issues with TD Bank; from the get-go, I was given a student checking account. At the time, I was an undergrad. It took me a few months to realize that my Savings account was not also a student account; as soon as I met with a representative at TD bank, it took a total of five minutes for the situation to be sorted out. TD has one of the best online banking sites I've come across. It's rarely ever down, and is updated quickly after I make a purchase. I have alerts sent to my phone to tell me when I'm getting low, which is truly a life saver. I also have the iPhone app installed, which is great for on the go balance updates, as well as money transfers with the touch of a button.My only complaint about TD bank is the non TD-ATM fees. I can spend $5 upwards in ATM fees alone unless I feel like walking to the bank. Luckily, it is not too much of a problem, since there is one close to my job.Overall, TD is great. I am even able to get direct deposit from my job. I love that the TD Banks in NYC offer dog treats as well as lollipops - both me and a friend are given a nice treat in addition to the excellent customer service."},{"date":"2012-07-02","name":"Mika","user_id":"thundernoire","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I've been with TD Bank since 2008, and out of all of the banks I have done checking with, TD Bank takes the cake. First and foremost, visiting their locations is always a pleasant experience; tellers are ALWAYS friendly and to the point, and usually I'm in and out in under 5 minutes. I almost never have to wait in line. Their hours are the big selling point; the branches in my area are open until 8 PM some nights! When I originally signed up before leaving for university, my father also opened an account. We discovered that it's very easy to transfer funds between accounts, which makes this a fantastic option for new college students and their parents. Additionally, most of their checking options have no annual fees or minimum balance requirements.My only complaint about TD Bank is that they have changed their fee policies a few times in the last couple years. Originally, all ATM transactions at non-TD ATMs was free (not including fees charged by the other bank), but a year or two ago, they started to charge a $2-3 fee for every transaction at a different ATM--this is in addition to any charges the operator of the other ATM charges. So, occasionally, if I need cash immediately and there isn't a TD ATM nearby, I end up paying $6 in fees to both banks. However, this is rarely an issue, as they do have a lot of locations. (I've also gotten around this by doing cash back at grocery stores\/drugstores... No fees assessed for doing it that way!)Overall, fantastic bank choice for your average college student\/young adult."},{"date":"2012-07-02","name":"Reese","user_id":"JimboW88","verified":false,"product":"TD Bank Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I just opened this account about a month ago, and so far I am a very satisfied customer.

Their customer service in the branches I have been to locally and also the online support have always been top notch. What I really enjoy most though it their no hassle checking. I only need to keep a balance of $100 in my checking account which is normally not an issue at all. I can log online each day and check my balance very easily and see each individual transaction.

I inquired about an ATM charge a few months ago, and they gave me all of it back. It was stunning! Another great positive toward TD Bank would have to be its rapid transaction rate. I was in Canada for a spring break a few years ago, and I called them in order to have money available in the country, and they had no difficulties helping me have fun in another country.

On top of all this, they have a ton of locations where I live and banking with them is very convenient. Their checking program is free and their online banking system is very well done.

I run my own business and sell at a lot of craft fairs. So most of my money comes in on weekends, or I get checks from other banks. The other local choices (Citizens who charges $7 to cash a check and the employees are down right rude, or Bank of America who is only open 5 days a week 9-4) just did not meet my needs at all. I can go to TD bank any day of the week and they are open nice and late every day of the week. They gave me an account with no questions asked and even issued an ATM card instantly in the store! I later lost my ATM card and cancelling it was super easy over the phone and another card was given within minutes of getting to my local branch. They offer nice kid\u2019s savers account and give them $10 each for reading books over the summer. They also have a change counting machine without fees which is much better then the coin star machine I used to use. I have yet to had a bad experience about them and talk highly enough of the employees at the Epping, NH branch who remember my children\u2019s names even though I have only been a customer for less then 1 month.

The minimum balance required to avoid monthly fees is very low. When a dispute arises, they give you credit right away. I had made an online purchase, and my account got charged by an identity theft company who got my account number at the time I made the purchase. TD Bank provided me the phone number of the merchant who had debited my account, and refunded the money to my account right away before beginning to investigate it.  Their customer service phone line is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so you can resolve a problem as soon as you notice it. If your debit card gets lost or stolen, they replace it on the spot at a branch. You don't have to wait to get a new one in the mail.

I can't say enough about how much their employees go out of their ways to help.     They also not only allow dogs in the bank with you, but give them treats and little TD bandannas.  Sometimes the employees even bring their own dogs to work with them all day.  I love that.    I'd also like to present an aspect of TD Bank that no one has mentioned yet.  TD Bank treats its employees very well and that, to me, is a true sign of a caring, organized, ethically run business.  Their employee benefits package is phenomenal.  They also pay a third party company to provide a free and confidential \"complaint hotline\" service to all employees.  Basically, an employee can call and rant to someone about his boss- or anything else stressing him out- for as long as he wants, and the call stays confidential.

My online banking is simple and easily accessible from wherever I have an internet connection.  The customer service is excellent and I find that there is rarely if ever a wait for me to speak with a bank employee.  Another excellent feature of TD Bank is the hours.  My local TD is open nearly every day, and is open past 'regular business hours', which, as somebody who works during the day, is an extremely helpful feature.

The tellers at the branch I go to are always friendly, and despite the fact that I only go there about once every two weeks, they always seem to remember my name even before I hand them the bank slip with my name on it.  To me, that makes every visit a little more personal and is part of what keeps me coming back.  I have not encountered any problems with this bank and I have been faithfully keeping my money with them since 2008.  When I first signed up, I was told that ATM fees would be paid for by the bank, but since then, that policy has changed. Also, sometimes when you call them things can go slow and take a while, so I prefer to do all of my banking online (their site is easy to use, even on mobile devices) or in person at the bank.  Besides that I have no gripes with the service I have received and will continue to keep my money with them as well as have them handle any other monetary needs I may need.

The account is great as it has a low monthly maintenace fee and you are able to get your first set of checks free of charge or at a discounted rate. TD Bank also offers a lot of other features that some banks dont have or if they do, they charge for it. One of the features I love the most is the free online baking and bill pay. In todays world it seems like we handle most of our business online so this is very convenient for me. They also offered a debit card rewards program which gives me points for purchases that I make using my card. Finally, one of the most important features to me when it comes to banks is their customer service. TD Bank easily has the best one I have had the pleasure of dealing with so far.
