[{"date":"2020-04-20","name":"WalletHub","user_id":"WalletHub","verified":false,"product":"PNC Personal Loans","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"PNC Personal Loan ReviewPNC personal loans have low APRs, ranging from 9.24% to 19.44%, based on applicants\u2019 creditworthiness. While you might be able to find a lower minimum rate from other lenders, PNC\u2019s maximum is one of the lowest around. That means even people who just barely qualify for a loan will still get a good rate. Plus, PNC further minimizes costs because they don\u2019t charge an origination fee. PNC offers up to $20,000 in funding, with up to 60 months to pay the loan off.There are a few drawbacks to PNC personal loans, such as the fact that rates vary heavily by ZIP code. PNC isn\u2019t as transparent as they could be about approval requirements, either. However, the benefits definitely outweigh the shortcomings.

I went to open a PNC credit card to take advantage of 15 months 0% APR to do a balance transfer and pay off existing credit elsewhere. It has been over 2 months and PNC STILL has yet to successfully complete the transfer - however they have absolutely no problem showing that I owe them this non-existent balance, as well as making me pay on it (they denied two pleading requests to please freeze my account\/do not charge until the balance transfers are finally done which I think is reasonable at it has been over two months). Neither capital one nor chase have received this balance transfer amount from PNC as they were supposed to 8+ weeks ago, and now it is showing I have double credit amount out on 3 cards instead of my previous limit on 2 cards. The first PNC representative I called was avoiding questions and telling me misinformation. The second PNC representative seemed better but still the information I was told seemed extremely inconclusive. I am beyond disappointed with PNC and this experience. I have been a PNC bank\/checking customer for over 10 years, always recommended them for banking, and therefore totally trusted them in this credit card process.

That is to much info to give out over the phone just to access your account. Use your own judgment and caution if you are thinking about BBVA as a \"reliable credit card company\".

All other credit card companies offer free copies of statements from almost any time period. The poor reviews I've read here are accurate. While they do offer credit cards at competitive rates, the customer service agents are rude, vague, uncaring and incompetent; they offer inaccurate information which changes from agent to agent. I've also been told a \"manager\" would call me back to resolve my issue at least 5 times, as the manager is in a \"meeting\" and can't speak with me at the moment. I have not once received a phone call from any \"manager.\" In addition, there seems to be no complaints department, as I was once transferred there, only to find myself at a strange computerized menu which was meaningless.

Fine, tomorrow I will be moving ALL my money somewhere else. I was a good customer, and they did what they did because they can. My advice if you have their card, get out or suck it up, don't challenge them even if your right, they will ruin you.

PNC doesn't take points off your score -- they merely report your payment history, current balance and available credit, which impacts your score.  It's normal for your score to fluctuate a few points every month.  But a '24 point drop with no explanation' - ridiculous.  Unless you made your payment 30+ days late - and this will clearly be in the report - your score dropped due to some other reason, that likely wasn't related to your PNC card."},{"date":"2021-04-20","name":"Gary Allen","user_id":"cruzinil","verified":false,"product":"PNC Personal Loans","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"<p>Imagine a PNC commercial loan officer walking into your office offering $100K \"undocumented\" loan and another $150K against a property.

I loved that they cared that I was a student and that their customer service was usually helpful. A few of my loved ones even started banking there because I referred them.  I no longer feel safe depositing my money for school or work into this account. Here\u2019s why:Without a job for some time, I have not made much use of my PNC bank account. Yesterday morning I went to deposit my tuition check and I realized that 19 overdraft fees (almost $700 worth) were  taken from my account. I spent a good portion of my day trying to work something out with them. The opt in & opt out option is very confusing to me and doesn\u2019t make much sense since you can still accidentally over draft either way. I did not purposefully overdraft my bank account. PNC bank feels entitled to these fees, especially during a time such as this one. Where is PNC\u2019s empathy for the customer? I am currently in the process of fighting to keep my life going until I can get back on my feet. Luckily I finally landed a new job and I will be taking my paychecks and tuition funds elsewhere. I will say that regardless of time spent over the phone and the situation at hand -I spoke to 5 out of 6 outstanding individuals yesterday. Aimee was very condescending and mean. I did not appreciate her attitude towards me from the moment she got on the phone. The other five people I spoke with were very supportive and helpful (as much as they could be).

I opened 2 tickets with PNC and this issue never got solved. After a week I asked to close my account and they still charged me a $25.00 closing fee (even though the issue was really on their end). If you have multiple electronic accounts and\/or online financial services, I do not recommend PNC. At least it didn't work for me."},{"date":"2020-10-27","name":"stephen jones","user_id":"drakefla2003","verified":false,"product":"PNC Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"I have kept this card for 10 years only because of balance transfer offers.

The attorney wired the payoff payment to PNC who acknowledged the receipt  3 days before the end of the month.  PNC assessed a late fee which was then wired from the attorney to PNC.  PNC then incorrectly reported the mortgage payment more than 30 days late because they said it was their policy to hold the payment which amounted to 18 years of payment rather than apply the fund to the loan on the date they received the first payment which was for the total amount quoted in the payoff.I have no idea why  they would report the loan delinquent when the had enough money from my attorney to pay 17 or 18 years worth of monthly payments. I have spoken to their escalation department and every customer service rep who much receive very little training and have no empathy or concern with customer service or correcting their error.

This time while the money was transferred out of my account, the recipient has no news 4 days later. The only information I get through the app is a confirmation number, I cannot even get a printout of the information that was used for the transfer. Of course, that will not help the foreign bank at the other end so I tried to get a more detailed statement of the transaction. The branch cannot help because the transfer was done through the app. I was transferred to the online customer service. Now this is an entirely different world. After a reasonable amount of wait, I am told that it will take 2 weeks to give me a statement of the transaction and I may even have to pay some fee. Unlike the people at the branch, the young lady on the phone was clearly not interested in helping me, she was more interested in reading the lawyer approved disclaimers multiple times and would not even listen to me. Eventually she agreed to let me raise the issue. I was put on hold. About 20 minutes later I was just summarily dismissed as the line went dead.I guess summary dismissal is the only thing left for me to do with my BBVA business account.As a side note, I also tried to use the app to do a business wire transfer to a bank in Hong Kong several months ago. Every time I tried to create a recipient account, the app would crash, forcing me to retry. After too many times I gave up and went to the branch. The bank person was able to verify that there was a problem with the app as far as transfers to Hong Kong were concerned.

They informed me that I would have to wait the 10 full business days before I could do anything.  So today 5\/12\/20 is the 10 full business days and I did not receive my debit card and called them.  They told me it would be arriving by Fedex no later than Friday.  I called corporate to get a tracking number and it was not yet available as the card was just ordered today. I  really need my card and explained this to them as I have 2 different cancers I am fighting and a few other medical conditions that keeps me quarantined with this covid thing going on. Corporate was very nice and helpful  and the branch was very nice but I really hate liars.

I have never seen a bank make it so difficult to withdraw your own money.  On other online banking sites such as Marcus (Goldman Sachs) and CapitalOne, they give you the option to close your CD upon maturity and will transfer the money in that account to an outside account free of charge.  Not so with BBVA.  If you want to close your CD upon maturity, you must either visit a branch (hard to do when the closest branch is 2.5 hours away) or send them a physical letter instructing them to close the account and send you a check.  This letter must be received by them within 7 days of the maturity date, otherwise your CD will automatically renew.  There is no way to do this electronically, which is ridiculous in this day & age.  Had I known this, I would have never done business with this bank.  I hope this review helps you to avoid the same mistake.Other issues: Your interest will not accrue monthly so withdrawing before maturity means absolutely no interest will be paid (they will of course penalize you if you withdraw too early).  They don't state this upfront so it was quite a shock to me when the first month went by and my balance didn't increase.When you send electronic messages via their Secure Message Center, don't expect a reply if your message is asking how to close an account.  They won't answer you (again, they make it as difficult as possible to get your own money from them).

My credit score plunged by 93 points in one day.Full story: a few months ago, I missed a payment. I always pay my bills right after I receive them in the mail, but this one must have been lost. I received the following month's bill and saw that there was a missed payment and a late fee. I called them immediately and over the phone, paid the balance in full (as I always do), from my checking account. Another month or so later, I'm reviewing my accounts and see a withdrawal from my health savings account from PNC. Confused, I call my bank and they tell me it was submitted over the phone. I finally realize that somehow, someone made an error and withdrew the money from my health savings account to pay the past due amount from the previous statement. While it\u2019s possible it was my error, I have my regular checking account number memorized so it is highly unlikely it was me. But anyway.I contact my bank and they instruct me on how to dispute the transaction, since I\u2019m trying to avoid the penalties associated with using my HSA for non health expenses. They tell me to contact PNC, which I do. I inform the PNC rep that the money was taken from the wrong account. I try to make another payment from the correct checking account for the amount. I am unable to do so because PNC doesn\u2019t allow payments for higher than the current balance on the account. The rep tells me she is making a note on the account, and to contact them when the money is taken back.Because of Covid 19 there is some delay in processing this because I have to sign papers for my bank and send them back through the mail. So another few weeks passes. Finally, I see that the money has been redistributed to my HSA. I admit I didn\u2019t call PNC immediately. I just assumed that the amount would be added onto my next bill, or that they would give me a call if they needed it before then. I am, after all, only a phone call away. Just to be safe, I am planning to call them in a few days just to make sure and see if they want a payment.So today I get a notice from a credit monitoring service I use that there has been a settlement for less than the debt from, you guessed it, PNC. I call them immediately and find out that they have reassessed a late fee, and processed the payment as delinquent from January when I originally was late, therefore making my account two months past due. They have taken away all my rewards, closed my account, and reported me to Experian. I just don\u2019t understand how a company that wants my business could treat me this way. I am of course disputing the severe ding to my credit, and have paid my total balance in full as of today, which I would have done immediately if they had ever bothered to call and ask before taking such drastic measures. I very much hope they decide to withdraw the settlement from my credit report, and the missed payment, as I've worked very hard for literally years to get my credit score into the \"excellent\" range and now it's back down to \"good\" in ONE DAY. I honestly wonder if they were looking for a reason to close my account as I pay my balance in full every month and accrue rewards. Regardless, BUYER BEWARE, they treat you like an enemy and not a valued customer."},{"date":"2020-04-24","name":"Michael","user_id":"michaelh19","verified":true,"product":"PNC Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"I don't even know where to start!

They claimed that my bank rejected the payment and by the time it was corrected, it was 30 days late. Becaise pf tje 30 day late, the reduced my credit by $6,000 and two of my other cards reduced my credit lines about the same amount.  As a result, my credit score declined over 100 points.  I spoke with them and sent them an email with all the documentation.  They declined to correct it.  I went to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and filed a complaint.  Within a week they changed my report to list me as \"current\".  In the meantime, no one would reinstate my credit  lines,so bottom line was I lost 100 points off my credit score(s).  They also charged me late fees many times and reversed them with a phone call, but when the charged the late fee, they would not allow me to use the card. I would have to call and go over my payments, they would admit I was right and allowed me to use the card again.  Their \"award winning\" app is the worst app I have ever experienced and I could go on and on, but not worth the time. Customer service is non existent with no recourse when they make a mistake (and they made many).  I finally took out a loan to pay them off, even though their rate was decent.

I was livid because they never asked me for paper documentation or gave me an email where I could send in the receipt showing the original amount even after my repeated attempts to ask them where I could send in my documentation or in this case the receipt. How can you deny a claim when you did not fully get my side of the story NOR would you let me send in my supporting documentation? This is fraud and I would like my money back. I contacted the restaurant and the manager has conveniently been out EVERY time that I call. This place is not close to my house and I am a teacher so I have not had the time to drive there. The server ended up getting a pretty big tip as I left cash on the table and he wrote in his own tip. BBVA does not even care and I get conflicting answers each and every time I call this horrible customer service department. They are an awful bank and they did not do their due diligence when it comes to my claim. I called today, March 17 to open up another dispute and I asked them about the old one and how I could proceed. I was told by a Jose P. that they could not reopen or mess with the old claim from Jan 8th because it had \"already been done\". I spoke to a Jose P. on (March 17, 2020) and he was very rude. Determined to not give up, I called again today, March 17th and spoke to a Daniel who told me that they could, in fact, reopen an investigation as long as it is within 90 days. I may have missed my 90 days by now because of BBVA. I just want my money returned to my account. I have the receipt showing proof and they don't even want to see it.

I deal with a lot of banks and BBVA is at the very bottom.  They get your money with a teaser rate and within a few weeks the rate drops to something like 2\/3 of market rate.  Their electronic banking is the worst.  Difficult to link accounts and once you link them, low limits on transfer amounts.  When you try to take money out, there is a $5000\/day and $10000\/month limit and also a $3 fee.  What bank charges a fee on EFT transfers? Want checks -- they link you to an outside vendor who is happy to sell you checks.  I called to see if there was any other way to transfer funds out and the experience was terrible.  10 verification questions, including provide your full account number, full social security number, full drivers license number, amount of a recent deposit, etc.  Then the person couldn't help and was not even familiar with the interest rates or transfer options and limits on BBVA accounts and couldn't be bothered to look it up.  She sent me to another person who went through the whole verification procedure again.  I then asked whether I could just close the account.  Sure, but to do that you have to send a fax (who uses faxes these days?) with all of the same verification info, plus also a copy of your identification.  The reason they use fax rather than email is because it is more secure (like a fax is really secure, right?)  This bank is beyond a waste of time, it is unethical and luddite.

As I always do I tried to set up autopay so I no longer have to worry about missing payments. For some reason their app wouldn't allow me to enroll in autopay without opening a BBVA checking account. So I just made sure to log on and make my payments. About 3 months of card use and I find another section in the app that allows me to set up autopay. This time it works, my payment is processed and I see that my account says autopay is active in the app. Fast forwards 2 months and I check my account on a whim only to find that I have missed a payment and autopay is not active. So I quickly pay my bill and call BBVA customer service. After waiting for 20 minutes I finally get someone on the line and explain my situation. The lady shows no sympathy and instead tells me that I will have to file a dispute with TransUnion credit bureau. I also ask her how I can enroll in autopay and she tells me that they will have to mail me a waiver that I have to sign and mail back before they can set up autopay. Fast forward another 2 weeks and TransUnion tells me that no change will be made and that I should talk with the financial institution if I feel there is still a mistake. Meanwhile, my credit score plummets 150 points and my credit limit on the card is dropped from $5,000 to $800. So, once again I call BBVA. This time I get a much more helpful and understanding woman on the line and I again explain my situation including my efforts to make a dispute with TransUnion. She quickly refunds my late fee, which I greatly appreciated, and tells me she will file a dispute for me to have the late payment removed and my credit limit increased to it's original limit. I then ask about setting up autopay and she transfers me to a man who walks me through setting up autopay on the BBVA app. It turns out it was the exact same process I had done before and there was no need to sign a paper authorizing autopayments. After nearly 2 months of trying to correct my credit history I finally received a letter telling me that they would not be removing the late payment from my account history. Needless to say I canceled the card and will never be using BBVA services ever again. The only reason I gave this company 2 stars instead of 1 is because the helpful lady during my second call refunded my late payment and actually tried to help me out."},{"date":"2019-12-23","name":"79lpwj","user_id":"79lpwj","verified":false,"product":"PNC Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"This has got to be one of the worse banks.

I think Credit Karma said 12 month no interest on purchases and balance transfer so I signed up for the offer. So I called the 1800 number explained my situation. The person on the phone told me the 0% intrest only applied to balance transfers not purchases and If I pay 100% of the balance they would remove my interest, I told her fine so I moved money from my investments account to my bank to pay off the whole account. When I called back to remove the interest they refused. One Lady said that oh we already removed the interest because we gave you $150 sign up bonus you can use that bonus towards the interest payment you made. LOL I can\u2019t believe she said that Most companies pay a lot more than miserly $150 as a signup bonus. Anyway the interest was Only $100 so I just paid it but PNC must really train their employees and supervisors and not make false promises. If they told me they would remove the interest they should do what they say the supervisor must have told me the interest is valid so we must charge you that interest about 5 different times on the phone call If that was true I don\u2019t know why the person I talked to before her told me that they would remove it.

I budget my money very well so I\u2019ve never had an issue with overdraft fees or anything. The issues I\u2019ve had are few and far between, but were very frustrating at that moment. Overall, they\u2019re a pretty good bank and it\u2019s not worth the hassle of switching banks as I\u2019m sure the all have issues from time to time. I just wish they\u2019d open a branch in the Hudson Valley area of NY so that I have a brand nearby should these issues arise again\u2026My main issue is with the mobile app. Unfortunately, my current employer doesn\u2019t have direct deposit so I get a paper check every week, and the closest PNC location is at least an hour from me, so I use the mobile deposit every week. There were 3 weeks in a row this year where the mobile deposit didn\u2019t work at all on Friday evening, which is a pretty inconvenient time for it to go down when most people get paid at the end of the week. This has happened sporadically before, but for almost a month straight, it really made me consider looking for a different bank. Most of the time there are no issues though, so I hope it stays that way.Another small issue I had recently is with the customer service not being properly trained and giving incorrect information. A check that I deposited via mobile deposit into my account bounced (insufficient funds on the end of the person who wrote the check). Not a big deal as I had funds to cover the loss. Customer service told me I had to wait 48 hours and then I could deposit it again via mobile (or come into a branch location, but I\u2019d have to travel an hour plus). I didn\u2019t see how it could deposit the check again because that check number was already counted as a deposit and figured it would reject it as already deposited. But, I waited 2 days per her advice, tried again, and (no surprise) it said I couldn\u2019t because the check had already been deposited. I called customer service again, and was told \u201cI\u2019m not sure why she told you that, but that\u2019s incorrect.\u201d I could have gotten the replacement check from the issuer and had my money 2 days sooner had the first girl knew what she was talking about."},{"date":"2019-09-29","name":"KIMBERLY WOLFE","user_id":"kwolfe384","verified":false,"product":"PNC Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":2,"review":"Trying to use the app from my phone has many many glitches and constant problems.

I received ticket # ******** on 7\/23\/19 from Jason and was told I would receive some forms to fill out and sign within 10 days.  I never received these forms nor did I receive the dispute acknowledgement that they legally were supposed to send me within 30 days.   Also this dispute has not been resolved within the two billing cycles they are supposed to have resolved it within legally.  I called them again on 8\/8\/19 asking again why I've received nothing and what was going on with my dispute and spoke to Andrew who stated he knew nothing about any forms and told me to wait longer.  He also gave me the phone # to call the dispute department directly.  I called again on 9\/5\/19 directly to the dispute department and spoke to Leona who stated that nothing has been done on my dispute and the ticket # was just notes stating I had started a dispute.  When I complained about no one working on this dispute and them just giving me the run around, she stated she would put me on hold and \"get this dispute to the finish line\"  After leaving me on hold for a half hour, she just transferred me back to the original customer service department again!   I spoke to Leon and insisted on speaking to a manager so he transferred me to someone named April who was just as useless and unhelpful as everyone else I've spoken to at BBVA.  She said she couldn't control the mail if I didn't receive the letter, but wouldn't tell me that they had even sent one.  She also wouldn't tell me why there were not any correspondences in my online messages or any copies of this non existing letter or what if anything was done on the dispute.  She again told me just to wait and maybe this would end up in arbitration!!  When I told her I was fed up with the run around I was getting and the terrible customer service her company has she couldn't have cared less.  She stated \"do what you have to do\"  when I told her I was filing complaints against BBVA.   She said she would escalate my dispute to another manager but wouldn't transfer me to them so I have no idea if she even did that or if she just added another note or did anything at all to resolve this dispute.

When I asked what they were doing, they just stammered and had no information. These people should be put out of business.

I opened up the account because I am new to the area and doing business there. I also started on another sub business under my current business which is a property preservation company. My sub was going to be business to business collection. I informed Mrs. Jones that it was new to me and I new very little about the workings of it worked but was learning how to do it. She asked me if I knew how much money would be going into the account I told her I was not sure but I told her possibly big sums and doing wire transfers to pay the money to the company we were suppose to be working for. I asked her how much could we deposit at one time and how long it would take for a check to clear, she said you can deposit any amount and for the first 30 days it will take 2 days for a check to clear because it was a new account, then after thirty days it will take 1 day for a check to clear. She said there were no holds on wire transfers, money orders and or cash. So I began my new business adventure and received, a check in the mail for over $79,000, I take it to PNC Bank the next day and deposit it. The gentleman that works there runs the check and begins to inform me there would be a longer hold on the check. Mrs. Jones comes out of her office to say it could be but check your account in 2 days before I spend anything further confirming she told me 2 day hold. Now the reason the hold is important to me because I had already told the client that I was working for it would take 2 days for the check to clear, I did not care if it was 2, 5, or 10 days just give me the accurate information so I can inform my client when they would get paid. It resulted in me having to give them different dates which cost me the client because it appeared as if I didn't know what I was doing. The check was reversed back to the payees account by the payee and PNC Bank closed my account with no warning, no investigation till after the fact. They concluded and said the check that was received was fraudulent and although after 2 business days the check that was deposited was my ledger balance. Also PNC did not return or stop the check they were not even aware that the check was reversed until I informed them. So now if it was FRAUDULENT as they claimed how come the bank manager Katrina Jones did not know it until I informed her that my payee reversed the check back to his account. So they closed my account made me pay for a bounce check that never bounced and sent me a cashiers check in my business name. I went to cash the cashiers check at the same location 2217 W Market St, Bloomington, IL 61705 only to be told they could not cash the CASHIERS CHECK THAT THEY SENT TO ME THE OWNER because it was in the business name  oh and they wanted to charge me 2% to cash a cashiers check that they sent me.

Dropped off all copies on 11\/8\/18 at Painesville, Ohio branch, asking for a receipt for the paperwork, as I feared it could get misplaced.    I used a bright green manilla folder, with loan number, name, and over 30 pages of documentation.   Received statement of credit score via USPS dated 11\/1\/18 - 92 - an excellent score.  With no follow-up communication, called PNC on 11\/30\/28 - 1st call was cut off.  2nd call stated they never got information.  Called branch office where info was dropped off - 11:23 am - loan officer was with another customer, and would call back.  Called again at 1:02 - loan office was still with customer.  They called back at 2:19 - stating they cannot find the bright green manilla folder, with loan number, name, and over 30 pages of documentation that I specifically was concerned would get misplaced.  They will follow up with teller who took paperwork.  Called back at 2:23 - cannot find any paperwork - it was possibly shredded.  They asked if we wanted to resubmit.

On the 15th of October.  They recharge my account for the same payment that was already made and credited to my account which overdrew my account.  The day before I checked my account and $10 was in the account. I made a $5 dollar purchase at a dollar store knowing I had enough left in the account.  These pafoons canceled the first charge, it was not showing made on the 8th, and recharged on the 15th knowing it will overdraw my account just to charge overdraft of $32 dollars twice because at that time the $5 payment overdrew too.  Customer Service is incompetent, read from a script and do not assist you at all. In another account, Someone made an online purchase for $65 on my account out of Africa.  I saw it pending the next morning.  Immediately contacted so call Customer Service Fraud dept to stop.  All they had to do was stop the payment because it was pending. But noooooooooooo, this fool on the line (Juan) said they had to wait until it is not pending and then he could put in for an investigation.  And yes, you guessed it, it overdrew may account and they charged not just $32 but, and additional $25 called an extended overdraft payment.  This has happened at least twice on another of my checking accounts.  I have proof when the original payment was made.  I never had to deal with so many incompetent people in the banking industry before in my life. The only thing he did was cancel my card and ordered me another.  This was on 10\/05\/18.  I called them on 10\/18\/18 to follow up because I did not hear from them and found dumb Juan did not file the investigation.  I was livid and went off on them.  And do not ask for a Manager.

Last week, I logged on to make a payment and received an error message saying it didn't go through. So I did it again. This morning, I see that BOTH payments have gone through. Of course I called, and was told that since the payment was made using a checking account from a different bank (I don't have any other accounts with BBVA, and never will), I have 2 options: 1) call my other bank and have them put a stop payment on one of the charges, or 2) provide \"proof of payment\" and BBVA will send me a check. Since a check won't help me in the short term, I called my other bank. As I suspected, it is too late for them to put a stop payment on the charge. So I called BBVA back, and was told again that in order to receive a check (which will take too long, but at least it would be something) I need to provide \"proof of payment\" even though it is RIGHT THERE on their website. It shows both payments made on 8\/2, AND it says that my next payment isn't due until 10\/2 (meaning the second payment was applied to September). I asked for a supervisor, but that didn't help at all. Not only am I to provide \"proof of payment\", I am expected to MAIL IT TO THEM. Not email, not fax. SNAIL MAIL. They want me to print out a balance sheet from my checking account (which, when I asked for verification that that's what he meant, he was very condescending, as if I was stupid to want to confirm) showing the balance before and after the transaction. And MAIL it to them. That was the last straw. I will just figure out a way to cover the extra money they took from my account, and will happily be able to skip next month's payment.

The ATM charged my account but did not dispense any money or receipt. I immediately called the number on the ATM which only directed me to contact my bank. It was late at night so I called first thing the next morning to file a dispute. They credited my account within a couple days... thought problem was solved. A month later I received a letter saying my dispute was denied because it was an \"authorized transaction\" and they were taking the money back. I called and spoke with  the investigation assistance people who told me that it was denied because the ATM bank said their records showed the money dispensed. After many attempts to explain I did not receive any money she basically told me that there was nothing they could do because they reported it was dispensed. Basically it's a money making companies word against mine. When I told her I didn't think it was right to take the money back out of my account she had nerve to say they had to get their money that they had credited my account back from somewhere. What about my money?? They don't care. You would think a customer would be more valuable. They wouldn't give me any contact information for the ATM or bank who owns it, no other answers except it said you got money so we are taking it. Very disappointed in their lack of customer service.

They are bad at keeping deadlines and the details, which is quite anxiety provoking when trying to close on a home in 30 days or less. Firstly, they took almost 10 days to get an apprasial confirmed when we had an apprasail contingency in shorter than that, and each time they said they would keep a deadline they would miss it.  After that our loan approval was pending, we had all our documents in within 14 days of Escrow, but a loan administrator sat on the file for over  a week and did NOTHING to push it forward, meanwhile BBVA was not requesting proper documents from our employers or insurance which delayed further, and we had to step in.multiple times just to spark things going again. When it came down to the wire, they submitted our file for \u201creview\u201d and it took a whole week just to get the loan approved after they had already delayed it. This resulted in frustrating everyone involved in closing, prolonging escrow, worrying the listing team and sellers, putting our earnest deposit at risk, and also resulted in us having to take work leave (and resulting frustrations at our employers) and costing us money. We eventually did close (after they also made mistakes and needed additional documents at the last moment, that they should have asked for on day 1 of escrow). We appreciated our main loan officer doing what he could, but BBVA is severely lacking in professionalism and timeliness as an organization.Throughout this process I had to email and call them multiple times a week just to get an update response, often times they would not respond for a week. And in the end after me asking several times in a polite way if they had all documents needed, they still were lacking them in the final moments before closing.I DO NOT recommend BBVA if you are at all in a competitive buyers market as they will slow you down and cause your money to be at risk from their inability to keep any deadlines.

Their user interface and systems are inferior to other credit card companies.  They fail to relay important information directly to you (snail mail or even email would be nice) - no formal notification process (that I have experienced).Their information is inconsistent throughout departments.  If you have a problem, they are not able to deal with it like a 21st century company.  They send you to an actual bank branch.  What?  Regardless, you then play phone tag with their customer service reps\/managers that will not address anything in email...again antiquated.

My previous bank account was with a brokerage firm that was brought out and the new company did not offer a comparable service. So I saw ads for BBVA Compass all over the place online. I've had some good experiences with online banks in the past (although it had been quite a few years) so I figured I would give them a try. Big mistake. At first all was well. Account setup online was quick and painless. The debit card came quickly. They have a rewards program where you can earn cash back and that is pretty good (lots of retailers available). Besides that, TERRIBLE procedures and customer service! The nightmare began when I initiated a transfer from an outside account. I made a mistake by selecting the wrong account to draft from (I have a few all at the same bank - I selected the wrong account from the dropdown). I did not know that this happened until I saw an NSF fee on my BBVA ledger. Ok...that sucks, but I went ahead and redid the transfer, this time pulling from the right account. Transfer showed in my BBVA account the next day and all seemed well. I also had my payroll direct deposit credit two days later. On payday I go to use my BBVA debit card and it is declined. Checked the app and my balance was more then enough. So I called customer service and they said it was declined because the vendor was internet gambling (it wasn't - it was a payment on a lease that I had paid on previously). Their response was to have the vendor try it again. I told them no I paid another way. Went to use the card at a restaurant. Declined. Called customer service. Now I am told that my account is frozen. No warning to me...even through the app. No reason available. Need to talk to the fraud department. They said it was due to the failed external transfer. Rep seemed kind and seemed to understand. Said he refreshed my debit card and to give it 24 hours. Tried to use my card the next day. Declined. Called them back. Now they say I need to wait until Monday (this was the weekend) to talk to a supervisor. Called on Monday. Was told, in an INCREDIBLY rude manner that I would need to go into a branch to reactivate my account. I demanded to speak to HER supervisor. 10 minutes later she comes back on and says she got approval to reinstate my account (no apology though). I ask about some outstanding checks issued via Bill Pay that haven't cleared. She said that she saw the pending payments and they would be fine. A week later, get a letter from my utility company that the Bill Pay check was returned. Now I have to resend and pay their NSF fee. Then get a letter from BBVA Compass that my Bill Pay feature was disabled. Then I try to remote deposit a check. Come to find out that the feature to do that was disabled as well. This is all over a failed INCOMING bank transfer and my account was NEVER overdrawn. I have to get some funds wired to me. BOOM $15 incoming wire fee. Really? Who does that? Oh and I had to dispute a debit card charge. They took the full 10 days to review it and then declined the dispute. Unreal. I pulled all my money out and I am in the process of closing my account (they don't make it easy). Good riddance!"},{"date":"2018-03-26","name":"menninger22","user_id":"menninger22","verified":false,"product":"PNC Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"BBVA is the absolute worst credit card company I have ever used in my life. I can't wait to cancel this credit card no matter its impact on my credit score. They apply payments unfairly and contrary to the industry standard of highest-interest-rate first. Furthermore, they don't apply it until the end of your statement, so if you pay off interest then make as much in purchases, only half of your interest is paid off in the end.  Their responses in email (which take over a week to get after initial contact) claim that your Minimum Payment Due can be used to their discretion, and anything else is applied to highest-interest balances first.  Using the same arguments I use below, I have demonstrated that that is not even close to what happens.  The second you do anything that accrues interest, you will accrue interest until you have a $0 balance for at least one month.  Here is my story, with rounded numbers to maintain some semblance of privacy:I got the credit card for the 0% intro APY promotion. Thinking that applied to balance transfers, I transferred $2000 to this card in addition to general purchases. The only debt on my first statement was this transfer.The second cycle was when I began using the card for general purchases.  Halfway through the second cycle I went to pay for the first month, but saw that I had accrued $50 in interest.  When I realized the mistake I had made, and that the $2000 balance transfer was accruing interest at 18%, I immediately paid $2100 to completely pay off the transfer balance that was accruing interest.  BBVA claims that they apply the Minimum Balance Due in their discretion, and then apply payments first to the highest interest charges.  At the time of payment, I had $2050 under 18% interest and $500 under 0% interest. Thus, my $2100 would be allocated as $50 to Minimum Payment Due, $2000 to the transfer, and to $50 accrued interest, leaving a $450 balance accruing at 0%.Fast forward to the end of this second cycle when my balance is now $1500 in exclusively 0% APY general purchases.  I see another interest charge. After investigating, I found that I still had $750 from the balance transfer accruing interest. Now I'm confused. Not only did $750 of my $2100 go toward a lower-rate balance, but after that payment, my balance was $450.  How is there $750 of my original purchase accruing interest when the total balance was only $450?! Disgusted, I paid the balance in full -- all $1500 of this statement -- bringing my balance down to $0 to enter the third cycle.  I waited a few days for the payment to reflect on my account so I could see with my eyes that I had a $0 balance.  With a $0 balance, I can't have any charges anywhere accruing interest, right? Wrong.Fast forward to the end of the third cycle. Skeptical, I used this card sparingly, and my balance is only $400 in exclusively 0% APY general purchases. Well, good thing because there is still interest accruing! The $10 interest that $750 accrued in two weeks was not paid off by the $1500 because that interest isn't posted until the end of the statement.  So now I still have $10 accruing interest even though I've made only 0% APY purchases since the last time my balance was $0.Currently, I'm still trying to eliminate this interest. I am convinced the only solution is to pay down to $0 before the next statement end date, then make no purchases, only paying off interest still accruing, until the following statement end date. So here I am unable to fully take advantage of my intro APY because BBVA won't let me make interest-free purchases while anything else is accruing interest."},{"date":"2018-03-20","name":"summerallen0318","user_id":"summerallen0318","verified":false,"product":"PNC Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"A direct deposit was sent to a closed account.

BBVA sent e-mail confirmations that my account was NSF and there would be $.0.00 (zero) fees associated with this. They did not honor those messages and charged me $38 per transaction.

I called to have this corrected and they told me that the late fee would be reversed. I don't think it ever was.A month later I was in a declared disaster area and they called me to say that my payments would be deferred for a few months and I thought this was amazing because I spent every penny I had evacuating Florida. After being home for a few weeks I went to check my credit and I noticed that my account had been closed. I called my local branch and they had no idea what I was talking about and said my account was still active with a zero balance. I thought this was strange because I knew I had a balance because of the evacuation. I called back again about a week later and they said my account had been closed for non-payment. I told them that PNC called me to defer the payments and because they did not have notes in their system or any record of the call they dismissed me as if I just didn't want to pay my debt. I searched everywhere until I finally found my notes on who called me. I have been contacting them for about 3 months now to try and get my secured credit card reopened and get some answer to what was going on but always got the runaround.

I asked them to extend the deadline but they told me they might not be able to they would call me back. I doubt I will receive a callback. They can keep you waiting on them for almost 3 months but when it comes to them getting you to do something for them they can't give you enough time to work everything out. If I knew 3 months ago when the issue arose that I would have to make a new $250 deposit on my secured credit card I would have saved for it while they were \"working on the issue\" so my card wouldn't be closed permanently and my credit score could return to normal.This is by far the worst bank I have ever been with.

The total charge was $195. I requested to dispute $125 of it however, PNC filed the dispute incorrectly and disputed the entire $195. This was the first issue. I was given a $195 provisional credit while the dispute was investigated. On 7\/30\/2017 I no longer needed the charge disputed because I was able to get in contact with the merchant and everything was taken care of. I called to cancel the dispute and was under the impression that it was taken care of. It was never cancelled. On 8\/15\/2017 I check my account with the merchant and see that $195 was reversed. This caused me to incur a $75 fee. I immediately called PNC and was told that the dispute was never cancelled and that the dispute was filed incorrectly. They told me that they will cancel the dispute and everything would be reversed and that they will also reverse the $195 provisional credit from my account in 5 business days. They also filed a complaint in my behalf due to the error and negligence on their part, causing me to incur a $75 fee. The next issue occurred the following day. I was just told that the $195 provisional credit would be taken from my account in 5 business days. But THEY TOOK IT THE VERY NEXT DAY! This REALLY frustrated me. All the while I have been checking with the merchant to see if they had received the payment back since it was reversed. They still had not. 8\/18\/2015, 3 business days after the dispute had FINALLY been cancelled I see that the merchant STILL had not received payment. This outraged me because PNC wasted no time reversing the $195 credit from my account, yet is taking their precious time rectifying their own mistake. I call PNC and basically asked them \"if the merchant does not have the $195 and I don't have the $195 then where is my money????\" At this point I need to know why this still has not been taken care of. Mind you, this is a deposit for an apartment so it is a time sensitive issue. The representative I spoke with tells me that they do not show that the merchant reversed the $195 and that they do not have it either. So the merchant does not have it and now they claim they do not have it either and I surely don't have it and I don't even have the provisional credit that was provided. So in all I am out $270 because of PNC's mistake and they act as if they do not even care to rectify the issue. I am HIGHLY upset. This has caused so many issues. I have been a PNC customer for 6 years and as soon as this issue is taken care of I will be taking every penny out of my account and I will be closing my account with them. PNC used to be a great company but they have really gone downhill in service as well as in their customer service. PNC has lost a loyal customer.

I have been a loyal customer for over a decade. I would have never banked with this institution or kept this account open as long as I have if I knew that they fabricated fees like this and just take ridiculous amounts of money from a family barely making ends meet. I honestly believed they would do the right thing and I have tried to maintain this account in spite of what they were doing.However they don't care. They took as much money as they could and dismiss me by writing a couple letters acting as though I am wasting their time filing complaints with Better Business Bureau and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and attaching copies of the Account Agreement. I tried to get resolution without the need of any complaints or attorney fees and court costs and I was ignored.It is my understanding that unless a consumer chooses to opt-in for overdraft protection, their purchases will be declined if an account has insufficient funds. I should have never had any fees whatsoever from PNC on any check that they believed could not be covered should have been rejected immediately. Funds are available immediately if they are cash or direct deposits. This bank ignores these deposits, processed multiple checks and essentially took any and all of the money for themselves.Some shady banks have a policy of processing the day's largest transactions first (as opposed to chronological order), which increases the likelihood of multiple small transactions incurring overdraft fees. If customers don't have overdraft protection anymore, the banks can't collect. In fact a federal judge accused Wells Fargo of \"profiteering\" by employing overdraft policies that led customers to pay multiple fees. The bank was ordered to return over $203 million to their customers. I believe PNC should be held accountable for doing the same to their customers."},{"date":"2015-07-06","name":"Jack","user_id":"Forsyth","verified":false,"product":"PNC Savings & CDs","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"This really is a no-frills savings account.

Spending money so I can spend money just doesn't make sense. It's a common practice, but honestly no bank should do this. The monthly fee is fortunately waived as long as you make direct deposits totaling $500 or more. The overdraft fees are high with a $32 per overdraft transaction plus $7 per day your account remains in a negative balance. They do have a grace period of a couple days, allowing you to make a deposit to cover the overdraft within that time frame to null and void the fees. So while they are lenient in allowing you to correct your mistake, the punishment\/fee is still ludicrously high.Most of my deposits (direct deposits and checks) clear within a single business day and are available to use in my account. This is extremely fast, as most other banks take about 3-5 business days for funds to appear.The interest rate does not apply to me, as I normally do not save up the $2k mark. But even if I did, it's better off putting it into investments or a savings account with a higher interest rate. The interest rate here is laughable, but like most people, I use a checking account to spend money not save it. Still, if an account is advertised as \"interest checking\", the ability to gain that interest on your account should be more attainable.I use this checking account for disposable income, and like I said, I do not have $2k as disposable income per month.

Their Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend option was the first thing offered to me when I got a new job with direct deposit, and of course with the direct deposit they waived the monthly fee. I do not think I would pay 15 dollars a month for the online service knowing that there are free ones elsewhere, but I like it because it's free. What I like is easy transfers from checking to savings by \"clicking the pig\". He's very cute. I appreciate easy printouts of paperwork I need for taxes too. The app can be buggy. Sometimes the app refuses to open on my Android phone for no reason, but they do update it often and fix the problems every few days.

The online interface lets you see your savings right next to your reserve and spending and they make transfers easy. One thing I don't like about the savings account is that the interest rate varies from a lower rate to a higher rate and you only get the higher rate if you use the debit card attached to your checking account at least 5 times a month. Otherwise the savings interest rate is a default low rate like 1 percent. When you use the debit card at least 5 times, you get a higher savings around 5 percent.

The upside is that there is not an upper limit on how many points you can accumulate, so hoarding points is possible (but not recommended).  The balance transfer fee of 4% is decent, but not great.The issue is that you need very good credit rating to get this card.

UNACCEPTABLE. I have been with PNC bank for about 7 years, and until last week, would have given them a rating of \"A\", 5 out of 5 stars, in spite of having heard complaints about them without even looking for complaints.  Earlier this year, I suddenly started getting a $7 monthly charge on what had been a free checking account since I joined 7 years ago.  I inquired, they refunded the one month charge, and explained that they have no more standard free checking, but that I could avoid the charge by switching to virtual wallet.   I took time out of my schedule during their business hours, personally visited one of their branches, and signed up for virtual wallet.  They were quite helpful.  This was a couple of months ago.  Last week, checking my account online, as I have several times a week for 7 years now, I saw that my balance was zero, my account transaction history was gone, and also my messages to and from PNC in the \"secure message center\" had been erased.  When I called, a helpful sounding phone rep asked me to hold while he looked into it.  When he returned, he told me that PNC had decided to shut the one of my 3 accounts (all virtual wallets have 3 accounts as far as I know) which I was using, very obviously using, because they had sent a letter to me for verification and I had not returned their verification letter within 30 days. NOT ACCEPTABLE FROM ANY BANK:  They did not send me any message about this in the \"secure message center\" online where I check on my account several times a week.  They did not send me any email about this to my email address, which they happily send many advertising emails to each and every week.  They did not call me about this, at my phone number which they have on file.  Also, to my email address, they sent an email just last week that \"my online statement is available for viewing\" referencing the account which they had just shut down without contacting me in any way other than one paper letter via snail mail with a 30 day \"respond with our verification as requested or we shut your account with no other contact attempted\" policy??  TOTALLY INEPT AND UNACCEPTABLE.  Since I have contacted them about this, they have shut a 2nd one of my 3 virtual wallet accounts, and seem to be blocking my adding funds to the one remaining account. THIS IS HOW A BANK GOES FROM AN \"A\" RATING TO AN \"F\" RATING INSTANTLY WITH CUSTOMERS.  Period.  Bottom line, don't use PNC Bank, not for anything.  If you do use them, don't trust them.  Don't fall for their advertising gimmicks about virtual wallet.  One of the very clearly specified ways to qualify for \"free virtual wallet\" is to only deposit or withdraw money online or by ATMs.  I followed this to the letter.  What did I get, in addition to \"free virtual wallet\" ??  I got \"shut~down of your bank accounts, with no contact other than a paper letter which is basically a 30 day time~bomb.\"  People TRAVEL...  HELLO???  ANY such verification should have a 60 day time window before any such troubles, at the very least, even better, make it 90 days.  Shutting down customer accounts with NO OTHER CONTACT ATTEMPTED beyond the paper letter 30-day time-bomb is RIDICULOUS, PATHETIC, and TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE for any \"BANK.\"  A \"BANK\" should keep a customer's money IN the customer's account, and make EVERY ATTEMPT TO CONTACT the customer IN EVERY WAY before making ANY CHANGES at all, that is OBVIOUS AND CLEAR. For these reasons, I have changed my rating of PNC Bank from \"A\" to \"F\" with no stops in between, and warn EVERYONE AGAINST PNC BANK and their gimmick \"virtual wallet.\""},{"date":"2014-11-20","name":"Laura Danford","user_id":"mommydanford","verified":false,"product":"PNC Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I have been using PNC as my bank for 4 years now and by far they are the best I have had any dealings with.

My biggest complaints about BBVA Compass are that in one instance they only sent me a letter to tell me that they would be sending me a new debit card due to some kind of possible vulnerability Visa had alerted them about; I had recently moved and did not receive this letter, so didn't realize my credit capacity on my debit card was slowly lowering until I was denied a purchase at a gas station. I found it frustrating that they had not called or emailed me regarding this and had only sent a letter. I also found the frequent survey calls to ask how your experience was at your branch recently to be a little annoying; they called after nearly every transaction I made in the drive through or in the branch.

There are certainly banks out there that provide perks that PNC does not.For instance, many banks provide 24 hour overdraft protection. If you happen to overdraft, they give you 24 hours to get your account in the green before a fee. PNC does not provide this. I have opted out of overdraft fees myself, but occasionally an automated bill will dip my account into the negative. At first, I was stunned to receive an overdraft fee, but the bank explains that auto-bill pay is protected when you opt out. This was never explained to me at first, so the disclosure wasn't as clear as I would have liked. Customer service is always polite, patient, and helpful, but I can't think of a single thing that makes my checking account special at all. I have a checking account card. I put money in.

It takes about a day for any refund returns or deposits to reach my account, compared to about two or three days with TD and Citizens Bank. For people that don't have PNC Virtual Wallet, it's a really cool, new way to look at banking. When you open a Virtual Wallet account, PNC gives you three accounts, a Spend account (checking), a Reserve account (short-term savings\/checking hybrid), and a Growth account (savings). I did have one issue with PNC that was a little annoying. The way PNC does overdrafts, they take money from your Growth account to cover NSFs and debit card overdrafts. The problem is, there is a federal regulation of 6 electronic withdrawals from any savings account. Even if you make a deposit or transfer the money yourself, you will still have the amount transferred to cover the negative balance. Even if you call customer service, they are unable to cancel the transaction. If this happens to you, you'll be in danger of losing your account.

The Performance Spend account allows you to earn higher interest on your purchases, and rewards me for making debit card purchases by giving my \"Growth\" (savings) account a higher interest rate for the month.  I do not pay monthly fees for my account due to the amount of money I receive by direct deposit into my account each month.    Compared to other banking accounts, this checking account is by far the easiest to use and one of the only accounts that does not charge a monthly fee (if you meet the criteria).

There are somethings I dont like. I believe the monthly fee is a little too high at $10.95 and I really didnt like that when my family member sent me money she had to pay a fee and then they charged my account to receive it!

In addition, you get automatic discounts at many popular retail stores that cater to people who make business-oriented purchases. Being an online seller, I also get 300 free transactions per month, which I come in under. This means you won't pay a percentage of your transaction to the bank. Best of all, PNC allows you to deposit paper checks via cell phone picture. This saves me many trips per month because I simply deposit the checks from the comfort of my own home.

As PNC has a bank close to me but more importantly has free ATMs in the local Wawa and Quick Check it was an easy choice for me.I applied for an account online and was impressed how easy the process was. I received all documentation within a week and was given instant access to the online wallet. The wallet is an excellent online banking application that allows me to quickly and easily see my daily transactions and my total balance. It gives me some simple options such as transferring into savings, disputing transactions and seeing recent transactions. It\u2019s a very intuitive website and I constantly use it.I have an automatic deposit directly from my job and have setup alerts that tell me when the deposit is made. I have never had to go to the physical branch. I am very impressed with PNC Bank.

They took my information and told me to come back when I had a chance. When I did, they just handed me the paperwork for my new bank account: It was already done! They tell me everything that I need to know, and always explain the fine print up front. They tell me point blank what is a good deal, and what is not. I couldn't ask for something better.

Customer service representatives can sometimes seem like they are not very helpful, but when the issue is normally my fault I understand why. My customer experience issues have normally been me calling to beg them to waive overdraft fees or for similar reasons. PNC is still a bank and they need to charge these kinds of fees if you do not keep your account in proper order. I understand that, but normally if my account becomes overdrawn it is a great chance that I also do not have the funds to cover such fees. PNC has a branch in most towns in my state making finding one when traveling around the state very simple.

This is really a great product for someone looking to move away from traditional banking and do everything electronically. Their mobile application is fantastic and allows you to deposit checks right from the app. The performance version of the Virtual Wallet offers other perks such as ATM fee reimbursement as well. My only negative about PNC is that lately their services have been very shaky.

The $10.95 monthly service fee on the account is waived as long as I have at least one direct deposit of $300 or more each month. However, since opening the account, I've had a few issues. Some of the links on their online banking site do not work, and I had trouble receiving my checks and debit card after opening the account.

Their online banking was very simple to use, but it seemed that it went down frequently. It was easy to convert my earnings into actual rewards. I liked their customer service, which was largely comprised of live people, but towards the end of my time with this card, they switched overly to a mainly automated system that requires some annoying navigation to get to a person. Thankfully, I didn't have many problems with this card, so I didn't have to deal with that often. I'm not sure that it was the right choice for me at the time--I would recommend this card for a general consumer, but not for someone who's just starting out.

In general, customer service is good, very helpful, and willing to take the time to resolve an issue. I use their Virtual Wallet online, which has been extremely handy in viewing expenses, and saving money with their Savings Engine features. The downside: I initially signed up for the account, and there was a promotion going to get $100 free, if you met criteria for Direct Deposits and debit card usage. I very easily met all criteria within the first few weeks of opening the account. There was a supposed to be a 90 day waiting period, plus an extra 60 days for verification. I waited 6 months, and called in to the bank because I hadn't gotten my bonus. The representative, who claimed to head the department grilled me, and referenced other customers who had tried to get over on PNC stating they had signed up for one of their offers when they hadn't, since it hadn't automatically been deposited according to the rep. He made me research what ads I saw, and then he'd do research to find out what they were offering. He told me he'd get back to me, and when he called me, he told me he couldn't see a promotion for that time period. I called him back, and confirmed what ad I had been shown. He almost accused me of lying to him, and got very defensive, accusing me of doing so. I reminded him quietly that I was sure I conversation was being recorded, and that he would hear himself later on raising his voice at me. He calmed down, and eventually found the promotion I had been offered, verified again that I had met all criteria, and eventually credited the account. There have also been a few times where things were posted late to my account, but the bank did credit me the overdraft fees because they were in error. Overall, I use the account for its online features.

For example, if a deposit and withdrawal were pending in the same day, the withdrawal would be put before the pending deposit.

Another great aspect is they offer the Visa Zero liability. Any charges that are found to be fraudulent are not held against you. This was especially helpful to me on a trip to Miami when someone got my number and charged thousands of dollars worth of merchandise before BBVA noticed. All the charges were cancelled and I was not liable for any of them. I guess this is a fairly standard practice, but it really helped me out. The biggest problem that I have with this card is that the points you earn are fairly low. One point for every dollar spent.

By then, the bank was now PNC, and I picked their Points card because the variety of rewards they had interested me. Sure enough, I was soon using my credit card for everyday purchases such as groceries and gasoline in order to turn in my earned points towards items like gift cards for Target or Starbucks.

I have only had a few times I've had to contact BBVA customer service, and that's because it was my fault. I had been overdrawn and was charged a fee. I am on a fixed income so the fee really threw me off and upset me. I called the 1-800 number and explained the situation to the operator, who quickly reversed the charge and allowed me to deposit money to cover the overdraft fee.On two or three different occasions this has happened (all my fault, mind you) and the customer service has been absolutely fantastic and has reversed the charges incurred, allowing me to get my finances back on track.

Since then, a lot has changed. I am a college student, still banking with BBVA Compass, and for the most part, my experiences have been positive. The compass banks in the areas I've lived (Houston, TX and Auburn, AL) have undergone remodeling and have new computer systems, and my experiences have gotten better over time.Problem resolution has been an issue for me above anything else. For 3 consecutive months, my no-minimum student checking account was improperly charged a flat fee for insufficient funds, overdrafting my account the second time. I went into the bank and sat down with my banker every time and had it resolved, but the fees kept coming. However, every time I went into the bank, the staff was very helpful and apologetic, and all of the fees and overdraft charges were refunded in full and in a timely manner. Other than the few issues I've had with charges, I have found Compass to be a reliable and thoughtful bank, and it has undergone changes in the last year to two years that have increased my faith and trust in them.When I opened a new checking account for my university funds, I received a handwritten letter from the bank teller I've known for years wishing me luck at university and explaining all the forms that were sent along with the letter.

Their customer service is top-notch, I've never had any trouble with getting the help I need. I also enjoy that the switchover allowed me to keep my checking account with no fees.

To their credit, very few things changed once they did.  They still offer free checking if you use Direct Deposit, though that consists of them making a $10 charge each month, and then crediting it back, which isn't ideal, but at least it does get credited back.Their online banking is excellent.  I use the bill-pay services almost exclusively, as it allows me to import all of my bills and pay them from one place each month.  Setting up a biller that isn't in their system is easy but can be a bit lengthy, and there are many -- especially in the medical field -- that are not already in their system.Other than the $10 in\/out for Direct Deposit \"free checking\", I've had no issues with them, which is a pleasant surprise.  Their tellers are friendly and courteous as are their branch managers (at least in my city), and it really is a pleasure doing business with them, and not just something that you say.

I have been using PNC regularly for about three months now, and I actually enjoy banking; even more importantly I now enjoy saving money!  PNC's mobile apps and websites are what sets it apart from Bank of America, and all of the other banks that I compared.  PNC offers not only a checking and savings account (for free), but also for free, PNC offers a high yield growth account.  As long as you use your debit card for 5 purchases a month you get a high yield rate in this growth account.  Methods of putting money in this account range from direct deposits to punch the pig (a feature that allows you to save as little as $1 at a time at any time, hassle free.  On top of the extra account, the online banking is awesome.  It categorizes all of your purchases (gas, entertainment, groceries, etc.) for a quick glance at how you are spending; it even allows you to customize these labels and remembers them for later.  The best mobile feature is mobile deposit of checks.  Just snap a picture of front and back and you're good to go.  Adding electronic payment for credit cards is easy and convenient.  Once they are synced up it shows you when and what payment is due at the top of online banking whenever you sign in.  Scheduling payments is a snap, and hasn't failed me yet.Their customer service is great as well.  I have yet to have the need to go to a branch (amazing I know), but all of their phone customer service reps have been a delight to work with, and all of their policies seem very straight forward at this point in time.  I love that the debit cards have Visa paywave.. great for in and out at gas stations.  It really has been an overhaul of my financial life, which was once scary, and now I feel in control.Overall PNC is refreshingly convenient and dare I say fun to bank with.  They own all Wawa ATMs and their branch presence is growing daily with their recent acquisition of RBC.  I recommend PNC to anyone I know that I hear complaining about their current bank.

They are extremely friendly and have great customer service every time I go in there or have a problem.  I have heard people complain about unfair fees, but have never encountered any myself.  It is unfortunate that there are not more locations.  I have a couple that are close to my house, but if I am not close to home it is sometimes difficult to find a bank.  Also, it is not a fully national bank so if you are on vacation or out of town there is a good chance you will not be able to find a bank where you are.  However, Compass has always returned ATM fees from ATMs that are not Compass as long as I bring the receipts into a location.  This is an extremely helpful policy and helps to make up for their lack of banks\/ATMs around the country and is the opposite of my former bank, Wells Fargo, which charged me a fee from them on top of the fee at the ATM for using a non-Wells Fargo ATM.

Furthermore, the fees they charge for receiving international wire transfers are reasonable. I also have not encountered any issues using my PNC debit card throughout Asia.

About 3 years into it I started having financial problems and I missed 2 payments. I called customer service right away to explain to them what was going on. I was waiting for a small cash settlement to come in and informed customer service that as soon as the money came in I would be making my payment to get my loan current again and I would also be making the next month\u2019s payment to get myself a little ahead. I asked the customer service rep if this would be satisfactory and they said yes, it was no problem. On the day my settlement came in, which was only 5 business days after the CSR said it would be satisfactory they came and took my car away. No warning, they just took it. I had no clue they would do this since the CSR assured me as long as I made my back payments in the next 14 business days I would be fine. I thought someone stole the car until I called the police and they informed me PNC took it. I was furious and called the customer service rep I had been dealing with. She then informed me there was nothing she could do and the only way to get my car back would be to pay off the entire loan. This of course was nothing like what we originally discussed. She lied to me and told me things that she couldn\u2019t even follow through with. If I had known they could not wait for my cash settlement to come in I would have borrowed money from my father to avoid this whole mess. I realize I messed up by missing 2 payments but the CSR clearly lied to me about what my options were.

PNC, as of a year ago, did not have any locations in my area. I held on to my free checking account regardless, because after years of a hassle-free banking account, it was too good to give up. Luckily for me a Canadian bank name Flagstar sold all 27 of their locations to PNC shortly after I moved here and now I'm surrounded by PNC locations! I couldn't ask for much more.

When I visit their locations the staff have always been prompt, courteous, and very helpful. This reflects my overall experiences with Compass - there are some downsides to dealing with a smaller bank but I feel the extra personal attention they give might make it worth doing business with them instead of one of their larger competitors."},{"date":"2012-06-27","name":"Cari Oliver","user_id":"CariRose","verified":false,"product":"PNC Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"We switched from another bank to BBVA.

Also, my son is now working, and we wanted to set him up with a checking account, but we wanted some oversight.  They have a children's account that works great for this.

PNC stands out from other banks because they're truly a community bank. PNC offers an abundance of services from a virtual wallet, overseas debit protection as well as points exclusively for PNC customers. I've used all three of these services as well as their other numerous services. I love shopping so the PNC points which are equivalent to cash back\/reward programs that some credit cards offer, are a great incentive for shopaholics. The Virtual Wallet is probably my favorite tool that PNC offers. I travel a lot and this wonderful app which I downloaded via my IPhone shows me ATM locations (which are a life saver! Trust me, those ATM fees add up.), free overdraft protection, non-PNC transactions are covered for free as well as other perks. A Virtual Wallet is a really a variety of options all rolled up in one which offers banking at the click of your finger on your smart phone. I'm quite fond of the customer service that PNC offers because each banking specialist is truly involved with customers on a one to one basis. The staff at PNC makes sure that they're aware of the client that they're talking with weather you're making a deposit or interested in a loan. I also like that they're never pushy at least in my experience. If you're a student PNC is a great first bank because of the excellent programs and leniency that they offer students. Sometimes they even offer up to a one hundred dollar bonus for opening up an account with PNC. Free money is always good. I didn't get any rewards for opening up an account initially but I did get the chance to sign on with an awesome bank. There are plenty of different checking accounts to choose from. The PNC website is very simple and will help you direct which checking\/savings option best suits your needs.For me one of the other things that I love about PNC besides the Virtual Wallet is the investment and wealth management option. This program has allowed me to set up a retirement fund and make very small investments on Wall Street. I've become so much more aware of finances and the stock markets, which surprisingly I've come to enjoy. PNC really is in a league of its own when it comes to personal banking."},{"date":"2012-06-25","name":"James","user_id":"ZugZug","verified":false,"product":"PNC Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"BBVA Compass is a great place to bank for the most part. However, recently, they've started charging fees for having a checking account. As a long term customer, this seriously annoys me. Also, when I deposit large checks, Compass has a tendency to put a hold on them without any notification, occasionally causing me to overdraft my account, which everyone knows is a HUGE headache. Apart from these minor inconveniences, Compass is a pretty decent place to bank, and so far, seems to be better than alternatives. One really nice benefit Compass offers is the ability to choose your own design for their debit cards."},{"date":"2012-06-25","name":"Allison Martini","user_id":"abmarti","verified":false,"product":"PNC Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"Every time I go into a PNC the employees are so helpful.

During the time that we had accounts with PNC we also had another account open with a nationally known competitor.  Through my experience with this other bank I came to realize how good I had it with PNC and purposed in my mind that I would never switch.  One of the features that we use the most through PNC is their online banking.  It is really quite cutting edge and they are continually updating and adding features to their site to stay competitive.

My favorite part about this branch is how the non-teller office workers ask if they can help you when the teller lines are too long.

I had a credit union where I had so many problems with my money that I was miserable. I was skeptical about using another bank after having so many problems with my first bank account but after a few good recommendations I switched over to PNC.  Though the sign up process took a while, the employees were all very nice and kept the conversation light and comfortable. They explained all the differences between a regular checking account and a Virtual Wallet account to help me  choose which one would be more beneficial to me. I went with the Virtual Wallet account and they showed me the basics off their online site and how to use it. It was helpful because the site could get a little confusing on it's own. I've only had one problem with them in the year I've had them and they fixed it as soon as I noticed it. They apologized profusely over the simple $2 they were supposed to reimburse me but forgot to. A major thing I like is that they have their own coin counting machines. I am one of those \"penny pinchers\" who will collect every nickle, dime, and penny I find in the couch and put into a jar. When I get a full jar, I take it to the bank and the machine counts it for me. I can then either deposit it in my account or withdraw it as cash. It's free for customers which is way better than Coinstar's high fees. In the past 6 months, I've had about a hundred dollars in just collecting my change. The bankers are almost always polite and smiling though on the rare occasion you will run into the one who is having a bad day.

However, now that I have adjusted to the changes, I really like using PNC. Since it is a big, well-known bank, I can have all my accounts in one place and access them easily online. In addition to a savings and checking account, I was ecstatic to find out that I could refinance my mortgage. I ended up cutting off 8 years of payments by switching, so I was very happy about getting that lower interest rate by switching to a PNC account.

I couldn't find anywhere in the paperwork they gave me when I signed up to validate the charges.  Customer service is pretty good about straightening those mistakes up though they only allow  you 3 fee reversals each month.I love the online banking service they offer.

I can definitely say that things have changed alot. I would have rated it five stars when I started banking there. And I will say that I've never had an error occur in my transactions. That's crucial. But the bank I belong to used to be full of super friendly, customer oriented people. They would remember who I was and always be respectful and kind. Then some of there policies changed. I believe it was because they were bought out by a Spanish Banking Company. The first change I noticed was requiring me to take checks that I was depositing from a trading account into the bank to deposit them instead of using the drive thru. Not so convenient. And I wasn't even getting money (cash) back. I was simply trying to deposit an amount over their 500 dollar limit. I finally got a manager to sign off on being able to deposit these checks through the drive thru. But believe me when I say, she acted like she was doing me a favor. They also started charging for some services, that used to be free, like notarizing documents, and using my debit card at different cash machines. So I guess, I would rate them a solid three stars now. I long for the day when this bank wasn't part of a huge complex of foreign banks. But just a small local down home kind of a bank. Maybe I can find a review on here that will lead me to that kind of a banking experience. You know in your heart what five star service is like. And Compass Bank just isn't it anymore. I wish it was.

Well, the only compass that will truly point you in the right direction is an evaluation of the cards terms in light of what the competition has to offer. So, I guess I\u2019ll play compass for a minute. Starting with rewards, the BBVA Compass ClearPoints Credit Card gives you 1 point for every $1 you spend. Unfortunately, this is basically the bare minimum a rewards card can offer, so the ole compass is pointing away from the BBVA Compass ClearPoints Card right about now. You can\u2019t always get an accurate reading at first glance though, so why don\u2019t we see what kind of interest rates it has to offer. Well, it does offer 0% on purchases for six months, which is on the low end of the 0% spectrum but is still better than all those cards out there that do not offer a low intro rate. The BBVA Clear Points Card also advertises an introductory balance transfer interest rate of 0% - 3.99% for 12 months. Aside from the fact that only the people with the best possible credit are likely to get the 0% rate, the card also has a 4% balance transfer fee. Overall, the BBVA Compass Card\u2019s balance transfer offer is therefore not very attractive because there are cards out there that offer guaranteed 0% intro rates for longer and do not charge a balance transfer fee.So, that brings us to your alternatives since the BBVA Compass ClearPoints Credit Card would clearly just lead you astray. As far as rewards are concerned, my favorite cards are the Chase Sapphire Preferred (excellent initial bonus), the Cap One Venture Card (travel oriented 2% cash back card), and the Blue Cash Everyday from Amex (great rewards on everyday expenses). In terms of cards with the best rates, the No Balance Transfer Slate Card from American Express is the way to go since it offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 15 months and does not charge you a fee for transferring a balance. Oh, and you\u2019ll be able to get any of these cards with the excellent credit required for approval for the ClearPoints Compass Credit Card."}]
