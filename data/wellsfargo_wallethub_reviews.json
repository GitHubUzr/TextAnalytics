[{"date":"2021-08-11","name":"WalletHub","user_id":"WalletHub","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Personal Loans","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"\u00a0\nWells Fargo Personal Loan Review\n\u00a0\nWells Fargo personal loans have many positives, including high loan amounts, a lack of fees, and low rates. Wells Fargo is also one of the few major lenders with both unsecured and secured personal loans.\n\u00a0\nWells Fargo offers personal loans between $3,000 and $100,000, with APRs ranging from 5.24% to 24.49% for unsecured loans. That\u2019s one of the lowest minimum APRs available and a fairly low maximum compared to many competing lenders. Wells Fargo\u2019s unsecured loans don\u2019t charge origination fees, either. And while there is a $39 late fee, you get a 10-day grace period after a missed payment to avoid it.\n\u00a0\nWells Fargo\u2019s secured personal loans have a $75 origination fee and require money in a Wells Fargo CD or savings account as collateral. Their APRs range from 8% to 19.5%. These secured loans let people take out a loan with better terms than they\u2019d get without collateral, while still earning interest on their own money in the bank. People who pay on time will never lose their collateral.\n\u00a0\nAnother advantage of borrowing from Wells Fargo is that they serve people throughout the U.S. They have over 5,700 branches where you can apply in person with a credit specialist. And while Wells Fargo has had a past scandal involving opening fraudulent accounts, that didn\u2019t have anything to do with their personal loans.\n\u00a0\nWells Fargo Personal Loan Review Highlights\n\nWells Fargo personal loan rates: 5.24% to 24.49% for unsecured; 8% to 19.5% for secured.\nLoan amounts: $3,000 to $100,000.\nOrigination fee: $0 for unsecured; $75 for secured.\nLate fee: $39, after 10-day grace period.\nPayoff timelines: 12 to 60 months. That\u2019s pretty standard, though some lenders offer periods of 84+ months.\nFunding timeline: Up to 3 business days for approval and 1 additional business day for delivery of the funds.\nWells Fargo personal loan credit requirements: 660 for an unsecured loan. But Wells Fargo offers secured loans to people with bad credit.\nID requirements: You must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. You can apply using either a Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.\nCo-signers Allowed?: Yes. Only some lenders allow applicants to apply with a co-signer. Wells Fargo is one of them.\nPre-qualification: You can\u2019t pre-qualify for a Wells Fargo personal loan, but you can estimate your rates with Wells Fargo\u2019s calculator.\n\nWells Fargo is one of the largest banks in the U.S., and they\u2019re well-known for having a wide range of personal banking products, including credit cards and mortgages. But you shouldn\u2019t discount their personal loans. Wells Fargo offers some worthwhile terms for people with good and bad credit alike. Below, you can see how WalletHub rates Wells Fargo in our three major personal loan review categories: Terms, Requirements & Application, and Reviews & Transparency.\n\u00a0\nWells Fargo Ratings by Category\n\u00a0\nTerms: 4.6 \/ 5\n\u00a0\nRequirements & Application: 3.8 \/ 5\n\u00a0\nReviews & Transparency: 3.3 \/ 5\n\u00a0\nOverall Score: 4.2 \/ 5\n\u00a0\nThese scores reflects how close a loan offer is to WalletHub\u2019s definition of a 5-star loan.

I have had nothing but problems with them since. Unwarranted holds placed on numerous checks that resulted in hundred of dollars in overdraft charges on each occasion. When asked about the holds, I was given two different explanations in the SAME phone call by two SPECIALISTS. Each time they've done this I've had to spend an hour or more on the phone and an acceptable resolution only when I've threatened further negative action, like closing my account and switching banks. Today it has happened AGAIN. This was the last time. I have never borrowed a dollar from them in over a decade, have never been offered ANYTHING by them for my patronage. They have done nothing but siphon money from me with their dubious overdraft fees which quadruple the amount overdrawn and then purposely put holds on checks so more charges accumulate. They've had black eye after black eye with the feds now limiting their loan cap as a result of shady behavior amongst other sanctions and lawsuits. At this point I'd rather hide my money in an old mayonnaise jar than keep it in Wells Fargo. It'd be safer I think.

Only reason I keep is to have long term account in good standing. Not able to make payments from multiple accounts, multiple times a month. I.e. wanting to use safer payment of a credit card which offers more protection against personal liability for fraudulent charges as compared to debit cards which do not have this protection. Limits ability to pay on account after each purchase. Also limits ability to make payments from multiple different personal accounts. I.e. wanting to make payments from multiple accounts you have established for different categories\/purchase type\/accounting categories.

They may end up selling your mortgage to a bigger company like Wells Fargo but throughout the process you will get much better customer service. People who actually remember what you say or email and care about what you say to them so you're not repeating yourself many many times and also having to fill out the same form many times.

Even then, you are only allowed to spend your rewards in $25 increments, which is absurd. Capital One allows you to use your cash back in any amount.

Recently I was issued a check from Wells Fargo Auto due to an overcharge to my account from their carelessness. They issued the check in the wrong name so I requested a corrected reissue of the check. I originally began my complaint December 2020 and we are now in April 2021, they claim to be backed up. There is absolutely no way they are that backed up. The IRS isn't that backed up getting checks issued to everyone in the United States. AGAIN, someone has dropped the ball and not doing their job. If I have to blast this company name on every platform in order to receive what is due to because of their error, I will. Word of mouth can either break a company or make a company, my voice may not completely break the company but I sure will be heard and be part of the group who aren't afraid to voice their concerns and issues.  I'm actually on hold right now for the past 30 minutes with Dio at the executive office, instead of her listening she decides to place me on mute as if I don't understand how call centers operate, another example of poor customer service. She doesn't have the right to get frustrated of my complaint of not receiving an answer as to why it's taking so long.  It's not even about the check for me, it's the principle that they made errors from the beginning without having an explanation as to why and how I was overcharged up until now still not able to explain why it's taking so long to redistribute the correct check.

In 2012, I finally went back to Wells Fargo to open an account and they've given me a second chance, although I was on probation for 2 years. They did not issue me a regular Visa Debit card, but give me a secure debit card and I can only use it to withdraw money at ATM and cannot make cash\/check deposit at ATM till I become in good standard. Now, I am in very good standard with Wells Fargo and I tend to keep it that way. I even got 2 of their credit cards and just finished paying both my cards off.

I have never been late and I even pay early on my monthly mortgage. I wanted to pay ahead on my monthly mortgage. I called to MAKE sure that if I pay ahead that it would apply to my monthly payment if I made advanced payments. The mortgage specialist on the phone indicated to me that it would automatically apply to my monthly payments unless otherwise specified. (This call by the way was on my phone bill and even though they claim they record all calls, they claimed they could not locate this call. Another person working for Wells Fargo found my phone call and the investigator would not listen to it and continued to claim that they had no record of it.) I made a payment ahead of time and they applied it to principal which is exactly why I called to make sure that it wouldn't do. I found this out later when I logged into my account. I saw that I had late fees and I was behind on payments because they applied my payment to principal. When I called to ask for them to apply my payment correctly, they denied me stating that the time frame allowable to make the change had expired. When I asked to speak with a supervisor they stated there was no one else to talk to. I demanded to speak with corporate and they finally transferred me to a compliance officer. She didn't do much at all and took days to just deny me. Apparently, they record all calls and even though I gave them the exact date and time of the phone call I made in the beginning, they conveniently denied having any record of my call even though It was clear on my phone bill record. I am a responsible person and have never had any issues. For them to treat me like this is absolutely disgusting.

Rather than address the problem at hand on the minor's account after close to 3 weeks of filling claims and Wells Fargo\u2019s mismanaging affairs. The best Wells Fargo could do was to block my account in the 3rd week of their sitting idle on the job and locking me out of my funds. Again, it was not my account involved but I called Wells Fargo on my child's behalf. My account was never the issue and why my account is blocked because of event on another account, that beats me.  I am told I need to go into a branch to be identified like I am the criminal when I am the victim.

I went to deposit a check (FROM THE STATE OF NJ TREASURY) made out to my business and they would not accept the deposit. Stating that was not the name on the account. I set up an LLC under my last name and then another DBA with the company's name. I have deposited checks under both names legally for 15 years but this one day was different. I was told I had to call the inside of the bank and talk with a banker....in which I did. Anita told me that I would have to schedule an appointment and bring something that could verify my business as she could not help me. I jumped through all their hoops and finally a few days later got an appointment with Phil. Phil was 25 minutes late for our appointment with no apologies. I explained what happened...and provided him with my State of NJ business registration, Operation legal paperwork and my Official EIN paperwork from the government. He said he could not accept any of it!!! What is funny is I have a commercial loan with Wells Fargo in the name the company they are refusing to deposit a check that was written out to! What made matters worse is how Phil treated me in his office. He spoke down to me and was very curt. I initially gave him two proof of identities....and when he said he could not take them I asked him what else he needed. His reply was a business registration but when I provided that he got off the phone and said that was not good enough either. I asked him how I could have deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars into this bank and this was the first time a check was refused. He had a scowl on his face and said, \"I don't know what to tell you\". His handling of this situation and how he spoke to me was not professional ..I felt the issue was more of an inconvenience to him. After my treatment, the first 5 minutes, I turned on my phone recorder ......and at the end I told him about. He pointed to the door and asked me to leave. I asked him to clarify what he had said to me but he refused once he was aware of being recorded. I welcome a Wells Fargo to contact me for this recording as I am sure you would be interested in how your employees are treating your customers after a 15-year relationship. I NEVER had this experience with anyone else (the tellers are always so kind and helpful) so I am sure this was an isolated case but nonetheless it left a bad taste in my mouth.

They told me 10 months after I opened my account that there was an issue with my social security number. I went into the local branch right away, provided my passport, social security card, and state issued drivers license (all of which they took photo copies of). They told me that for the last 10 months, my credit was not being reported, even though I had a credit card with them. Although I was upset it took them 10 months to verify my identity, I had some sympathy since I must have provided a wrong digit while I was opening my account. A month later, I'm at the grocery store, and my card is declined. I check my wells fargo app to find out that they closed my checking account without telling me. There was no communication, phone call, email, or voicemail that they would close it. I called customer service, and they could not find any information as to why my account was closed, except that they couldn't verify my identity. They said all the details are hidden in their system, and only the local branch can see them. I referred to a previous case ID regarding the first situation with my credit card, to which I was supposed to receive a resolution, or be contacted that the process is taking longer, a month ago (I had not received either). Customer service could not see any of the information, refused to contact the case specialist who was working on my case, and suggested that I open up another case. They told me a cashiers check would be mailed to me in 1-3 business days, with instructions on opening a new account with Wells Fargo. Long story short, I opened an account with this bank a year ago, and gave them the benefit of the doubt despite their past sketchy behaviors as a bank. I've never had any issues with any other bank, acorns, or investing accounts in terms of my identification. The bank has yet to provide me with a clear explanation, deflects the situation and blame, failed miserably with communication, and has wronged me as a customer one too many times. I feel as if I cannot trust a single individual in this organization. Their practice is unbelievably sketchy for an institution of their size. I asked the customer service that since they could not see any information of my account or ask the specialist who is working on my case to reach out to me, if they were there purely as customer de-escalation with no access to information----- to which they responded: yes.

Seriously, if you're even considering opening an account with Wells Fargo, my advice would be to run in the opposite direction as fast as you can. My partner and I recently used Wells Fargo as the mortgage lender for our first home. We had read the bad reviews. We knew they had an \"F\" rating from the Better Business Bureau. We saw there were over 40,000 complaints about them to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the past 5 years. But they offered us a low rate and seemed friendly during the initial calls, so we figured it couldn't be that bad. Boy were we wrong. In brief, Wells Fargo made an error and failed to release a federally-required document (\u201cClosing Disclosures\u201d) three days before our closing date. They claimed to need price details from the title company, but the title company had provided those details weeks in advance \u2013 in fact, we have the email chain where Wells Fargo confirmed receipt of the information. Regardless, Wells Fargo didn\u2019t tell any of the parties involved that they were \u201cmissing fees\u201d until 12 HOURS before our scheduled close time. This error caused serious financial and psychological distress because we had to leave our apartment the day after our original closing date. Instead of moving in as planned, we had to:1) Pay the moving company to deliver our belongings to storage2) Pay for storage over a holiday weekend3) Pay for a second move from the storage company to our new home after closing4) Board our pet 5) Find lodging during COVID-19 with 12 hours noticeWells Fargo's negligence quite literally rendered us homeless. As if that weren\u2019t bad enough, they have been downright hostile to us since closing. When we asked Wells Fargo to reimburse us for the financial struggle they caused, they pointed fingers, displaced blame, engaged in blatant gaslighting, and refused to admit wrongdoing. Over a dozen calls to our case manager at the Wells Fargo Executive Complaint Office went unreturned. Since the deal is done and Wells Fargo has already made their money, they appear to have no interest in correcting their mistake. I\u2019m shocked and disgusted that Wells Fargo is still allowed to operate given the scandals it\u2019s been involved with over the past decade. I urge you, for your own good, DO NOT bank with them. Learn from our story and the tens of thousands of others who filed complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

In March 2020 two men came into my home and stole two unsigned, undated checks. I called Wells Fargo to cancel the checks, and they permitted the checks to get cashed. The criminals FORGED signatures and dates on the checks; after review, Wells Fargo then said that it stands by its decision because the checks were signed -- how does that make sense when the signatures were forged and clearly are different than the signatures supposedly retained on file?! The brilliant Wells Fargo rep who reviewed the case said that she wasn't aware that a request was input to cancel the checks -- so this shameless company fails to provide due diligence to protect its customers. This response took literally months to receive, yet they didn't even review the most basic elements of the case. Initially I was given an agent who never returned calls, only for me to later learn that Wells Fargo assigned the case to the wrong department. This company defines incompetence and borderline negligence in handling its customers finances. Meanwhile the police constitute this case as fraud and theft, but the folks of Wells Fargo permit this behavior. Wells Fargo is despicable, and I wouldn't trust it to keep a cactus alive, let alone protect my future finances.Customers should remove their money from this bank to keep it safe.

Paperwork was mishandled and documents were resent by Certified Mail with confirmation they were received. I was told they were uploaded with wrong info on them and that was another delay? Assured application was complete. After 3 months of process loan officer asks if my husband still wanted to pursue loan. What?! We've been waiting on you for months!  Needed proof of homeowner\u2019s insurance when Wells Fargo pays it through our mortgage! Totally incompetent? On purpose? Funny we were denied for an incomplete application! What a joke this has been after jumping through all of their hoops and waiting for too many months on Wells Fargo to close the deal. We feel this was all done on purpose and we will not be doing any business in the near future with Wells Fargo after being a loyal customer for many years. They should treat their customers better and stop being manipulative and dishonest.  Just say that these are hard times for loans, but don't blame the customer for all the problems Wells Fargo conjured up to stall loan.  Not happy customers at all!

I finally got personal fico credit scores about a month ago (731, 715, 720) and an upgrade and credit increase on my personal card. I don't know if that has anything to do with why Wells Fargo also graduated my business secured card with them, but figured it might be worth mentioning. (I wasn't offered an increase on my business limit by the way, only graduation.) My business also recently established a Paydex score of 80, with all risk scores being either low or low-moderate on D&B and 80 on Experian Business, but can't find my business through Equifax for whatever reason. Please note my business's credit was established through Net30 accounts with a few other businesses, not the credit card which does NOT report to business credit bureaus despite what some websites falsely claim. I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because of how ridiculously hard it is to get much information about anything when calling their credit department. My banker at the branch who helped me set up all my accounts is great though."},{"date":"2020-06-03","name":"Joe","user_id":"j_m_gray_92","verified":true,"product":"Wells Fargo Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"The card in general has the ability to give you freedom in the way of credit limits, but only if you already have a lot of money to put up for it first.

This was our 7th home, so 7 loans experience.   I was constantly on the phone trying to sign documents online which most of the time didn't work, had many glitches.  Volumes of paper were  sent for us as \"disclosures\" which was impossible to read through.  I spent hours with the lender working with him to get his system to work.  The loan did not close on time.  We were one day late but they did not offer to re-do the documents nor rebate us for the one day of interest we would have to pay and I was too tired to have to go through that headache again so did not press that extra 1 day interest payment we would have to make due to their inefficiencies.   In addition,  they didn't disclose all the fees until too late to the point that 2 years into the loan, we received a refund check for some of the fees. because they were required by law.   After the loan closed, the lender told  me I would receive a review request on how it went and said that the first three questions seem to read they were about him but they really weren't - so please answer all 5s.   We just re-financed this month with Rocket mortgage and it was the smoothest ever.

I was approved and was told someone was going to contact me. Fast forward to today, March 10th, not a peep from anyone. I called Bob\u2019s Customer Service they were very helpful and looked up the things I wanted in their inventory and answered all of my questions but they had no record of me applying. I had to check my credit report to see what the inquiry was listed as because Bob\u2019s goes through 3 different creditors. It was Wells Fargo that approved me.  So, the Bob\u2019s Discount sales associate was nice enough to give me the customer service number for them. So, I call Wells Fargo and the customer service representative couldn\u2019t find my application or any record of me for a half an hour. Finally, he came back on the phone and asked for my phone number. I gave it to him and he said, \u201cOh, this must be why.\u201d  At this point I\u2019m thinking, ok, I gave you my ssn and dob multiple times, you don\u2019t find anything, but something magically popped up when I gave you my cellphone number after 30 mins of being in hold? Odd. He proceeds to tell me, \u201cYou have been denied and you will get something in the mail within 30 days.\u201d What? I was already approved? Is this letter going to explain why I was approved and then denied? Because I know it\u2019s not because of my credit, I have \u201cEXCELLENT\u201d credit according to TransUnion and CreditWise. The whole thing just seems fishy. I\u2019ve never experienced such unprofessionalism. No email, no phone call and I had to track them down. They approved me, then couldn\u2019t find my information, then denied me. My plan was to get my living room furniture from Bob\u2019s and close out my Jordan\u2019s furniture account, but now Jordan\u2019s will be the one getting my business. I called Bob\u2019s to let them know that, and give them the heads up that they\u2019re losing business because of them.  Who else did this happen to and didn\u2019t tell them?

I have a mortgage with Wells Fargo as well as a credit card. Also, I have a Wells Fargo in the building of my job. This is why when I received an offer to open a checking account with them and receive $400, I thought it was a great time to try them out. The promotion stated that I needed to have direct deposits totaling $3,000\/month for 3 consecutive months within the first 150 days of account opening. I received the offer in May and opened the account and changed the direct deposit with my employer. Unfortunately, my employer requires a prenote (meaning the direct deposit change will no become effective until after an entire payroll cycle has been processed). Due to the prenote and the payroll schedule at my job, my first direct deposit of $1,500 came in June. I had 2 more $1500 direct deposits in July and then $4500 in August. My last direct depot before my maternity leave was August 30th and I'm still on maternity leave. After waiting for months for my bonus, I finally call the bank and I'm told I did not meet the qualifications because although I had $9,000 direct deposited in 3 months, there was $1,500 in June and $4,500 in August and it had to be $3,000 each month. This is so ridiculous. At the end of the day, I had $9,000 deposited within 3 months like the promotion said. The fact that this went all the way up to the executive offices of Wells Fargo and it was still not honored, makes me never ever want to bank with Wells Fargo. Even more, I would caution anyone else to bank with them either. I'm so happy I didn't go through the hassle of switching over all my finances to them as I intended to. I was disqualified on such a small technicality and the fact that had my maternity leave not started when it did, I would have qualified with one more direct deposit. No one seemed to really care or even consider what I was saying so I will be closing out my account and probably my credit card as well."},{"date":"2019-11-24","name":"Philip","user_id":"philipc_56","verified":true,"product":"Wells Fargo Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"Having the Wells Fargo Visa linked to my Wells Fargo bank accounts provides easy access to transfers and payments.

I don't mean for this to be a gripe fest but if I can stop you from making a mistake then I have succeeded. I have had this card for about 3 months now and I just closed it today. Let me state that I pay ALL of my bills off every month that they occur and then even ahead if I can. WF has a $1500 payment of mine in limbo as they took it out of one of my personal bank accounts but are holding it. They sent me a \"Payment Review\" notice on 9\/10\/19 and are now questioning if my pers bank acct is valid. The letter asked for a voided check or validation from the bank itself. I went to a local branch as told by cust. svc. when I called and provided a check and a copy of the notice. They also took a copy of my ID and sent it off to their finance dept. I was told at that time that it would probably take 1-2 days so I waited 3 days for things to process. I called back today and I was told that \"No!\" what I was told was wrong as it would take 18 days to process the review. WTF at this point. To top it off there was a new $25 bill out there for payment on 10\/4\/19. I asked how I was supposed to process it through with this current bank account that I had used previously. No real answer other than I could try and run it through and see what happens. I lost it and cancelled the card at this point with Lizette the C.S. rep as a lousy $2500 rewards card is not worth my time. I will soon be transferring my 401k out of WF shortly as well.

Never ever open an account online if you want to receive a bonus. Online account opening is easy, but it may also be a \"trap\" for the bank not depositing you the bonus. You need a BONUS CODE during account opening. This code will not show up if you open online even though the ad says it will be automatically applied, but the bank would not acknowledge this. I opened the account through their ads online, it clearly said that their \"bonus  code will be automatically applied\". However, I fulfilled all the requirements and waited for two months, they said they did not have my BONUS CODE. Are you kidding me? I went to their branches several times and presented the online promo page to them, they still could not figure things out for me. This made me feel like I was fooled by Wells Fargo and their promotional emails! $400 is not a big deal, but nobody likes the feeling of being fooled by others and doesn't know what's going on!2. Make sure you read all the terms and conditions, including the vast majority terms underneath their ads with much smaller characters. This is a common trick that most companies do. If you do not understand any of these terms or you do not know how to do, just don't proceed. You do not want to waste your time and end up getting nothing! 3.Make sure you have all the evidence with you when opening your account. They do not have the incentive to pay you any amount. You should do your job if some things happen!In General, all so-called promotional offers are tactic tricks.

Despite attempts for years now going back and forth with the credit bureaus AND WF Dillards, providing documentation of these proven critical errors on their payment website, proof that they gave NO late fee warnings (although it was their websites fault I was late) the credit bureaus have told me that WF Dillards is still unwilling or too lazy to budge on this. My credit score is literally flawless with 0 late payments and I keep an under 1% utilization ratio. QF Dillards alone has been preventing me from achieving an 800 score and has caused damages in me and my husband's life because we want to refinance our home when my score reaches over 800 like his. I am in contact with my attorney, about to begin litigation. I have found hundreds more people affected by this same issue. If you would like to participate in this too, please contact me. Hey Wells Fargo, this can all be avoided if you simply remove the late mark YOU are responsible for, which is not my fault at all. I have evidence of critical errors on the site during the time I submitted my timely payment, a track record of perfect on time payments with my 13 other credit cards, an email account showing zero warnings or notices from the company, and the evidence points to negligence on behalf of Wells Fargo.

Most banks have a minimum balance, but the highest I've seen is $2,000 before charging fees. Even the fees with other banks are much lower, like $5\/mo. - Customers are charged for new cards when they lose old cards. Most banks don't do this.- Customers are charged for new checks when then finished their old checkbooks. Most banks don't do this.- When calling customer service, there is a long wait and sometimes multiple transfers, where the customer has to repeat their information with each new person, or even from the voice-automated system to a person. - Customers are not refunded anything for out-of-network ATM charges. Most banks offer some reimbursement per month, as much as $20\/mo, or are free of charge altogether (which is rarer).These practices are hostile to the customer, and completely characteristic of WellsFargo when you read the news. There are so many other GREAT banks out there. Even ones that offer a cashback or small interest rate on your CHECKING account.

EVERY time I make the deposit, I see on the receipt and online that my money is available IMMEDIATELY - right at that moment. This is always always the case. However.....this week, during my super busy week, I made a slight error in balancing and therefore got slightly overdrawn. So, the very next day I IMMEDIATELY corrected my mistake by depositing a check into the WF ATM like usual. However what happens THIS time?? THIS time the funds are NOT fully immediately available making me STILL overdrawn even though IF the funds were immediately available then I would NOT be overdrawn. These are the moments where us customers need the funds to be available immediately, NOT when everything is okay and dandy, but in moments like these. Whoever is in charge of making the rules within the banking system needs to realize this on a moral level.It gives me bad memories of WAY back in the early 2000's where if I made one, just one slip in a purchase causing my account to be a tad overdrawn, it would charge a fee not for just that one transaction that caused it but for EVERY pending transaction which was highway robbery sometimes resulting in MULTIPLE fees in one day of $35 rather than just that ONE transaction that caused the error. Don't get me wrong, Wells Fargo doesn't do this anymore (thank God) but it's moments like this week that make me question the morals of this bank.I think within these next weeks I'll look into switching to Chase bank, which my family loves.

The buyer elected to use Wells Fargo for their financing. After the contract was submitted to Wells Fargo so that they could begin working on the file, the file sat in limbo (from 7\/21 - 8\/13) before being sent to processing.The buyer's agent and myself both tried to contact the bank on multiple occasions to get an update, only to NEVER get a response. Finally on 8\/7, I received an email from the loan officer stating that she had been out of the office for health reasons. I never got an out of office message and apparently there was no back-up taking care of her workload while she was out.After an additional week of no updates, I reached out to the branch manager and was told that they would escalate the file, but that they couldn't really talk to me about any details, as I wasn't the buyer or their agent. Keep in mind, I was not asking for any specific NPI or buyer details, but only enough information to pass along and set an expectation for my Seller. My Seller was counting on this deal to close on time, as she was taking a new job in Texas and was originally supposed to be there on 8\/27. The whole reason she was selling her home to begin with.Finally, Wells Fargo sent the documentation to the closing attorney, stating that closing would be set for 9\/13. When pressed to try and escalate, Wells Fargo told the closing attorney that they could possibly move closing up to 9\/10, but he never heard back from them.On 9\/12, all of the sudden each of the signatures that Wells Fargo had on the documents we provided all \"disappeared\", at which point they requested the documents be re-signed. After sending and re-sending the same exact documents, FINALLY, they saw the signatures.At 9:15 pm the night before closing, the loan officer sent out an email stating that there had been a \"miscommunication\" and that the file was still in underwriting, pending approval. Closing could not occur the next day and it would have to be sometime the following week.At this point, I escalated to the Office of the President at Wells Fargo and received a call from Nicholas Franck. Apparently an executive \"Resolution Specialist\". After being presented with the evidence showing that Wells Fargo had dropped the ball, he essentially washed his hands of the situation and was sure to tell me that, while unfortunate, Wells Fargo doesn't really care about the impact to the Seller because they are not Wells Fargo's customer.He also went as far as stating that he felt Wells Fargo did a great job because all they could see is that the application was started on 8\/13 and that they were able to get it clear to close in 30 days. He refused to acknowledge the PROOF I sent him showing that the application was completed on 7\/7\/18 and that the contract was sent to the LO on 7\/21.He did volunteer to coordinate a closing for my Seller, as she could no longer wait to start her new job in Texas. He stated that it would be easy for them to set up a closing for her when she got there. I told him that we would need for him to take care of coordinating her closing, but I had to send two additional emails and leave an additional voicemail for him because he did not respond.When Nicholas finally DID call me back, he volunteered no help at all, simply stating \"Wells Fargo only needs one document from your Seller and the closing attorney already has it. Try to get it worked out with them\".If you are a home Buyer, steer clear. If you are a home Seller, I urge that you CAREFULLY consider any offers you receive from a buyer who wishes to use Wells Fargo. If you are a real estate broker, I suggest you consider recommending one of your other preferred lenders.After a 14 year career in mortgage and banking and over 45 Real Estate transactions as a RE Broker over the past 2.5 years, this was BY FAR the worst transaction I have ever been a part of.

That is information I finally got straight from the mouth of a Well Fargo rep. I had a credit score of nearly 800 for most of my adult life. But went thru a hard time that impacted my credit. After starting a new business I signed up for a Wells Fargo Business Secured Credit Card in order to get things rolling again. As far as everything else is concerned this card is just fine. Good terms, etc. However I was told after a year of good standing with the card I would be \"graduated\" to a unsecured line of credit. Well it's now been over 2 years that I have had the card. I've run right around $250,000 thru this card in that 2 years and NEVER carried a balance let alone EVER been late. At this point I have other lines of credit and don't even need this line anymore. But at this point purely out of principal I called, fighting to have my card graduated. After about an hour on the phone talking with 3 different people, a customer service rep finally told me that it is \"very rare\" for anyone to \"graduate\" from this card. Obviously Well Fargo has no interest in moving on from their tactics of trying to open as many accounts as possible, even if it means lying to their good customers. I'm a small business owner with 6 Wells Fargo accounts. ALL have ALWAYS been in perfect standing! No if's and's or but's about it. I'll be closing my secured accounts, the business and personal account I have, and it will probably ding my credit for a while. But I'm not going to continue to let Wells Fargo see any profits from my credit card purchases and I am seriously considering closing all my other Wells Fargo accounts just on principal of them refusing to do the right thing. I played by the rules the Well Fargo put forth when I got the card and they don't hold up their end of the bargain."},{"date":"2017-12-29","name":"amymglass3737","user_id":"amymglass3737","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"I was told when i got this secured credit card that my account would be reviewed after 1 year.

I was in the hospital for a year and was put in Hospice with less then a week to live they said and I left. I did not find out about this until the customer called and I inquired as I wasn't sure I was still going to make it and wanted the money for my child as it was quite a large sum of money with all of the checks. They provided me the info and it i knew the person who did it. Guess they assumed I was going to die so if nobody would know. I did file police report and made a claim with Wells Fargo. They have proof video proof of the person depositing them The person still had accounts at Wells Fargo so they could have easily just reversed the charges give me my money back and charge the person's account and they denied it. I have proof that I was in the hospital incapacitated in isolation with very little chance to live and I also had messages text messages from the person admitting they did it and how they did it and still they denied it The person ended up fleeing to another state because they knew I pressed charges I did not receive my money even though I was in the hospital for you straight and several years in and out and could have used that money. If I tried to deposit a check for $10,000 or how about $5,000 maybe even two into my own account at a branch they are going to require to see not only my debit card but my ID because anytime I deposit a check of a large amount they do this. But a person can deposit a check into the ATM machine for over $10,000 without their name on it and they've never had a check deposited even close to that amount in the history they've ever had their account and they would let it go through.And even after all of this had happened and they're notified they know the person they know they're not supposed to have anything to do with my accounts They allowed that person to open up another account in my daughter's name that happens to have the same initials and very close to my name and I'm sure to you to use for the same intent. And when I found out they would not allow me or even my child to close the account The person opened the account for them and it was noted that they were the parent I had to call and threaten to file additional police reports to have them close the account. I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN. If they can do this to someone who was extremely ill and even if I was not I had the person who took it admit it as well as they were on video, they opened up a second account just to cash my large checks, I can prove without a reasonable doubt and that I in no way could have possibly deposited or signed the checks and then allowed that person to open an account in my child's name as their parent. My child is has basically same name so it was obvious why they would do it. Police reports were filed and the person still had accounts open so all they would have to do is reverse the charges. If that is not the WORST FINANCIAL INSTITUTION BUT DON'T KNOW WHAT IS!! I am going to make sure that anyone who ever mentions their name, wants info on a bank (I do get this often), a mortgage ( I'm a broker), CDs, investments, student loans, anything.

Today was the 3rd time in this month alone where I had to call them\/go to a branch to dispute an overdraft fee of $35.00. My issue was, that I was at a positive balance of $33.20 when I was charged the overdraft fee of $35.00. It was this fee that caused my account to go negative. But wait.. there's more! The description for why I was even charged the fee was \"$398.99\" for my car loan, which is the transaction that made my daily ending balance 11\/20\/17 $33.20. It was today on 11\/21\/17 that I was charged the overdraft fee, for going positive $33.20..BUT WAIT. THERE IS MORE: I went in person to the branch in Miami on E Flagler. The WF employee that was assisting me with my request (to remove the $35.00 fee that was making me negative). She saw the problem and was as bothered by it as I was. She contacted \"Bank Solutions\", where they basically gave her the perfect document to really mess me up: a document that reads \"all\" the same transactions I brought printed out (with the proof of the bank error) but in a completely different order. In this electronic document, my balance ended up -$7.00, which calls for an overdraft fee.Pause. Here's the thing: if you add up all of the debits and add up all of the credits, the difference will ALWAYS be the same, no matter what damn order they're in.Play.Get this: they were not \"permitted\" to print this report for me, the one that read -$7.00 being my balance. I work with balances for our tenants as  the accountant for a property management office. It is clear that I was charged an extra charge that would make the end balance a negative #.Done. Third time this month. Closed my account today, and am practically in love with Chase.

Let them get charged an overdraft for actually going negative.Also, remember that the company just paid out about $2million for messing up already.

I made a payment of $7000 and after 4 days they still had not freed up my available credit even though the payment was made electronically and had been removed from my checking account 4 days prior. The only answer any agent or \"manager\" was able to give me after numerous calls was \"we have to wait for the payment to fully clear\". What does that even mean in the age of technology?? The money was extracted from my checking account?! Again since they operate as a credit service provider for Dillard's they really have no interest in customer experience.

I did this reluctantly as I have had problems with Wells Fargo in the past but I decided to since I knew we would pay it off quickly. The charge was around $8000, my husband and I decided to pay $7,000 on  the first payment due and then at that point take advantage of paying the remainder 1000 off in 12 months offered, so we could keep a little extra cash. The first bill came in March, we paid the 7000, on the second statement we had 1000 balance with a minimum payment of $286 due. If we paid the minimum, we are forced to pay off this balance is 3 months. We called the customer service number and after an hour of speaking with someone who we couldn't understand easily due to the accent, we felt we finally got her to understand we were wanting to dispute the minimum payment.  It was obvious later she did not understand at all that the minimum payment was too high because she noted on our account that we wanted to dispute the entire claim. The next thing that happened was the owner of the floor company is calling to ask what was wrong with our flooring because we were disputing the claim!!! Now why would we pay $7000  on the balance if we were disputing the claim. After two months and dealing with different people and a supervisor, we have gotten nowhere. I feel we are being penalized for paying a large payment.  Why offer 12 months no interest if you force your customers to pay off a balance in 3 months!! I was very upset when speaking with the Wells Fargo supervisor and at no point in our conversation did he seem concerned or willing to help us.

Yep, \"I don't qualify for a fee waiver\". I asked If they would set up my auto pay AGAIN, they said, \"since the auto pay is NOT paying out of a Wells Fargo Bank, they cannot\" them trying to make you have them as their sole bank!

It seemed convenient to stop spreading debt around between cards. The problem was that when I got it, it had a fairly long 0% promotional period - 6 months, or 12 months. Since I was selling my home and moving at the time, I had a lot of expenses, and I took advantage of the 0 percent interest, just made minimum payments. I figured they wouldn't have offered it to me if they didn't want me to use it. Imagine my surprise when instead of getting a statement one month, I got a letter saying my account had been closed. I called customer service, and asked why - I hadn't missed any payments, and didn't owe them any money in interest - and they just told me they viewed me as a bad credit risk because I'd only been making minimum payments. They didn't offer to open the line credit again if I paid more, and wouldn't answer my questions beyond that. That was the main thing that left an impression when I was dealing with them, that they gave me interest free credit (without me asking for it), closed my account (for no real reason), and weren't helpful when I tried to get some insight into the process.

Its for people who CANT get unsecured cards..yet. You are paying an annual fee and high interest because you are paying for your bad credit . They are giving you a way to increase your score over time. this is your so called \"last ditch effort\" to show future creditors that you can be responsible enough to get credit for that $30,000 car or that $250,000 home. I personally feel the interest rate and reasonably low annual fee is right in line with what this cards target audience IS. And you wont even have to worry about the high interest if you pay your bill early. Use it for getting gas each week and then pay it a few days later. pay your cell phone bill with it... then a few days or a week later, pay it off. .  Dont let it hit the credit cycle and youre getting free points on your credit score when they report you paying on time and using a low % of your available credit which ive learned is a big factor in determining credit. The deposit you place is again, part of the price we are paying to build or rebuild credit rating.

Since the loan was for me, I figured I would make it easy on her to do a bank transfer so I opened a wells fargo account since they had recently taken over our Century bank, and that was who she banked with. The day I set up the checking account, it took over an hour and a half to get through with answering questions and seeing what I was eligible for, but I had a great credit score, and a good history with my credit union. So I was approved for a checking account. They didn't explain anything to me, just handed me a debit card and asked me to order checks, I declined. I didn't have the cash to be ordering checks especially since I never use them. They said there was not a required amount to keep in the account and that if I didn't use the account at least five times a month, I would see a service fee. I thought ok cool. I had a few things I needed to do with the cash I would be getting into the account that day and figured that if I swyped the card for a soda at mcdonald and some diapers at walmart along with the three bills I had to pay would cover me for the month. So my friend sent me the loan, and I paid the bills, and got me a drink and bought the diapers. Everything was fine from what I understood. I deposited my next check into wells fargo and was going to alternate every week, one in wells fargo, one in my credit union. Well, after I deposited my check, I asked the bank to transfer a small amount back to my friend as my first payment, and they did, assuring me there was no charge for it. Then I got a letter in the mail two weeks later. I was overdrafted close to $100 dollars. The check I put into the account had been $138. I sent my friend $25. I spent less than $50 out of the money because I had been using my bigger check which was in my credit union. So I looked online at my statement, I had a $12 service fee, a $14 service fee, a charge for bank checks, and some other fee which was attached to my account transfer which made the check charge overdraft my account, so I had an overdraft fee of $45 bucks and then I had grabbed lunch for like $6 thinking I still had around $70 in the account, but it was already overdrawn, and the bank let it go through and charged me a second overdraft fee. I closed my account the same day. I went to the branch and had a bit of  a fit. The tellers were amazing. Really nice. But I wound up having to pay out of my credit union part of what was owed, even though they did waive one of the overdraft fees and refund my account for the checks I did not order. they made me still pay for the second one from me buying lunch because with my account already overdrafted I shouldn't have been buying lunch. HA. But I didn't realize it was overdrafted. I had used my debit card more than five times that month, so shouldn't have had a service charge, but was told bill payments did not count as debit transactions, so I didn't have it hit 5 times, and then the second service fee was because my account was lower than $100 at the end of the month. They never told me I had to keep a hundred in my account. I still don't see why I had to cover any overdraft when they didn't decline my card which was on an account that had already been overdrafted, and was  only overdrafted because they ordered checks which I declined getting anyway. If they hadn't ordered checks, even with the service fees, I still could have paid for the lunch with no overdraft. Not a good experience. Great customer service. terrible information about what they charge for, and messed up way to deal with a mistake that was THEIR fault.

They instituted the monthly fee for clients who don't have direct deposit or maintain a (somewhat ridiculous) minimum monthly balance. They raised the fees for overdrafts significantly. They seem determined to take more of my money every month while claiming to be \"free\" than their predecessor did. But the part I find most irritating is that the completely user-friendly and transparent online account that I like so much when I banked with Wachovia was replaced with a system that makes it really difficult to keep track of your actual balance. Their balance alert system, which I am signed up for via text, is also sometimes delayed nearly twenty-four hours before I receive an alert after my balance changes; someone who had stolen my debit card could have had a field day in that amount of time before I ever received notification.

They were bought out by Wells Fargo. I was informed there would be no changes to my account so I didn't bother to sit down and bug a rep. I later found out that someone tried to convert my account to a new Wells Fargo equivalent without informing me. This account was supposedly as close as you could get to the equivalent of what Wachovia was offering me. But this account required so many hoops: A) So many transactions a month AND mobile banking AND some other service I can't even remember... OR B) a $500.00 min that you can NEVER touch in your checking... OR C) A hefty membership fee. I was in college at the time (hence the STUDENT account) and so I had very little money in the bank. I remember I went to deposit a check at the ATM and realized that BOTH of my accounts (savings & checking) were overdrawn. I tried to keep a 25 dollar min in my checking in case of emergency, but I was charged a membership fee for not having $500... all the money I DID have was gone. When they charged the fee, there wasn't enough money in my checking... so I had set up a safety by having money automatically withdrawal from my savings in the event of an overdraft... but it didn't matter because there still wasn't enough money there to cover the fee in the linked account either. Now both accounts were overdrawn and I was charged again for an overdraft in my savings and for the overdraft in my checking from when the transaction occurred to make that linked pull and the money wasn't there. Three new charges for having no money that summed to a total well over $100. I called and was on the line for over an hour in an attempt to fix this. They forgave the second overdraft on my checking since I was not notified of the new terms to my accounts, but I still owed over $100 in fees. And I didn't find out for two weeks that this had even occurred. No one called. My mail wasn't goint to my temporary apartment's address while I was at college. And I was getting so much junk mail from them once they switched over that the legitimate bank emails started making it into my junk file. This happened to me MONTHS after the big transition to the Wells Fargo flagging and such. And this was NOT the last tragic even that occurred. It was just the first. I had some cards stolen almost year ago in Feb 2014. I called in the claim, and two weeks later I went into a bank location hoping for updates on my account. I was not greeted. I got tired of standing so I found a chair. The offices were glass and I could see people in them, and they could see me.... We even made eye contact a few times.... They had no customers, so I figured they must be on break, but after the better half of an hour I went up to the teller to ask how I could speak to a representative. The teller informed me that they weren't on break and came out and talked the the person I'd been having a staring contest with. The rep was short with me. I figured it was just a bad day, but I have gone to that location several times (since its the closest one to my house) and her presentation always seem to be the same. It took MONTHS for me to figure out what happened to my accounts and it was a disaster. I decided to close my accounts after that. I walked back into the Riverside, Jax location on that day and sat for 20 minutes playing the staring game with that same woman from before. I eventually stood up to leave and go to a different location, but by then I was more than annoyed. I was tempted to stand on a chair and scream \"I need an adult!\" in the hopes that that same woman would finally become gutsy enough to come out of her office,... but instead I drove 50 minutes instead to my favorite Orange Park, Fl location to make sure I was treated with some dignity when I closed my account...."},{"date":"2015-10-23","name":"Chaz Hicks","user_id":"chaz","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Savings & CDs","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I have my Way 2 Save savings account with Wells Fargo and I have been very pleased with Wells Fargo.

My business requires me to pay constantly for things using my credit card. Consequently, I make several payments a month to the card too, to free up space. For this reason, I have never been late, and I would think they would be happy with me as their customer.Anyhow, one day I made a large payment, because I needed the available credit to pay for a large transaction, and noticed that three days had passed and even though the payment clearly showed in the transactions of my card, the available credit did not change. I went ahead to pay for the transaction, and was notified that my card had been declined. I then called Wells Fargo to understand what was going on, and they told me that because the payment was unusually high, they can at their discretion place payments on hold, or float as they call it for a period of 30 days to verify the payment.What I came to found out was that Wells Fargo has the right to put any payments made to their credit cards coming from a different bank\u2019s checking account on hold, to verify it (ridiculous to say the least). In other words, because I have a checking account with Bank of America, and made the payment from that account, they can decide to not post it, and place it on hold for up to 30 days.Honestly, who can run a business waiting 30 days for payments to clear? Moreover, who pays for someone else\u2019s bills? I can understand holding large transactions, because it could have been a lost or stolen card, but to place holds on payments makes no sense.In the past 3 months, this has now happened more often and for smaller payment amounts. I am sorry but as a business owner, I do not have the time to call every two weeks to make sure the payment I made cleared on my account and help them verify it, so I can use my own credit card, and give them more business.

They get the wire transfers every night. Now it can even be instantaneous as we all know we can move money around immediately from count to count even if it's not at the same bank. This is not new technology. Banking institutions are always trying to keep your money for an extra day or an hour. If you've ever noticed that they someone will charge you a fee if you want your payment in a day or two days or they'll charge you one or 2% to get it immediately depending on whatever it may be. The reason for this is if they keep those funds for one or two days they use that money to make more money. I understand it seems small but imagine how many customers and how many people are banking with them or student loans or checking and savings CDs any type of transaction just within their banks Now imagine that with all the transactions they do with check deposits from other banks transfers they get that stuff that night but for every day they can hold it they're making more money lending out that money getting interest on that money and so on. 30 days is a ridiculous amount of time I don't care since 2000.

It was called \"Central Fidelity\" back then, switched to Wachovia and then Wells Fargo. Overall, their business practices are pretty standard within the industry. They are a for-profit company and it shows. One of their most frustrating practices though, is that each morning, they put through debits to the account before they put through deposits. This means that if you've setup a transaction to debit knowing you have a deposit to back it up, you could potentially overdraft. I find this to be shady and deceptive. They act like they care about the consumer but their practices say otherwise."},{"date":"2015-07-17","name":"Kristan M Hall","user_id":"Khall42377","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Car Loans","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"After needing a quick $2000 loan from my bank I was sick by the advertised APR so they told me about this bank called Wells Fargo and I went to them. After meeting with a young and very eager Associate I was leaving 3 hours later with a car loan for a wonderful New Cobalt.(mind you this was a couple years ago) Well after getting an amazing deal for the below average credit I had at the time, I was able to get a good fee and got the car a couple days later. After a couple months I wanted to change vehicles since it was no longer meeting my needs. The new associate I talked to was even newer and less experienced, he told me they couldn't do that then after talking to someone who has been there, they said bring everything in and they would see what they could do. Well after 3 more hours I was told I was stuck with it and there was nothing that they could do to get me out of this contract but they could make a new contract for another vehicle, even though I couldn't afford it and they saw this on paper. They approved me for it and I ended up defaulting in 3 months because everything was going to a $350 car payment and a  $400 SUV payment and all the other rent and utilities I pay, I wanted to get out of it and they were talking about extending my loan so it would take longer to pay at a lower rate and they would make more.

My most serious issue that I've had with them is that they post payments once I make them but then take them off and re post them days later. Sometimes they'll be pending for about 3 days then come off and re post 5 days later which is really annoying. None of the other banks that I've been with have done that. This caused a serious issue because I have them linked to pay my mortgage and I ended up paying fees to them and my mortgage company for NSF fees because Wells Fargo took off some payments so I assumed I had enough money to pay the mortgage and then days later I got some emails about NSF from my mortgage company.

It comes with many nice perks such as the Dillard's reward points, but for that APR I have to say NO. I comes with pretty hefty late fee of thirty five dollars if you forget and pay late too, pretty harsh for a card only for those that have a proven track record of good credit and so are far from dead beats. I would also say if a card these days is going to charge 3 percent foreign transaction fee, they should have the courtesy to put the chip in you will need in order to be able to use it in much of Europe these days."},{"date":"2015-02-27","name":"Jordy Adams","user_id":"jordykasko","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"The Wells Fargo Rewards Credit Card seems about equal with other rewards cards that I've possessed, like American Express Blue Sky and Amazon Chase Rewards. All seem to have a base earn rate of around 1%, with opportunities to go higher based on where you spend money and other perks. Redeeming for airfare is a helpful option that I used often with Blue Sky, and it makes me more inclined to get and use this card. The late fee seems a bit high, but I have little sympathy for people who actually pay a late fee or ever need to know what the interest rate is. Responsible users will not pay interest or late fees, so that has no effect on my opinions about the card. Overall, I'd be interested in this card if the rewards were more than my current card, but at 1 point for every $1, I won't be getting it or using it."},{"date":"2015-02-26","name":"Brandi Alexa","user_id":"christina_gee_3979","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"The launch of the Wells Fargo Platinum Credit Card seems very exciting. This card seems to offer new benefits, but of course with benefits come costs and drawbacks. In this review, I\u2019ve attempted to go over a number of the pros and cons of the card. Let\u2019s review the basics. The card requires an excellent credit score. The intro rate on purchases is 0% for 15 month, and the same applies for transfers. The regular APR rate spans from 10.15% to 24.99%, which is pretty standard, if not on the lower side of interest rates. There is no annual fee, and the balance transfer fee is 3%.There is a max late fee of $35, no max overlimit fee or penalty APR, and a grace period of 25 days. Cash advances are available on this card at a rate of 23.99 to 25.99%. There is a cash advance fee of 5%, with a minimum of $10. Finally, the foreign transaction fee is 3%, and smart chip is available for this card.So what are the pros? Well to start with, the Wells Fargo Platinum Credit card offers a zero liability program, which automatically protects cardholders from liability if fraudulent or unauthorized charges are made to the card. Additionally, the card offers Visa benefits such as auto rental collision damage waiver, Emergency card replacement, Roadside dispatch, Travel accident insurance and Travel and emergency assistance services. All of these are nice perks, especially for those who are avid travelers. The card is also verified by Visa, and cardholders can create a unique password to use for online shopping purchases. Finally, overdraft protection is available, which enables you to link the card to your checking account in order to avoid overdrafting. Finally, one reviewer mentioned that they can immediately deposit cash into Wells Fargo ATMs and make payments on the card this way, which is certainly a nice bonus and pretty much unheard of with other credit cards.What are the cons then? While they seem minor, I have noticed a few reviewers say that Wells Fargo\u2019s customer service is not always the best. Additionally, it looks like charges can be late to post to this card, which makes it difficult to know exactly how much you are spending on the card. Another thing I noticed is that if you are looking for a card with rewards, i.e. cash back, gift card rebates, airfare miles, gas points, dining out rewards, hotel stays, etc., this is probably not the card to choose as it does not offer any of those perks. These perks certainly do add up after a while. Why not spend money and get added value doing it? However, this is not a concern for everyone.Overall, Wells Fargo Platinum Credit Card holders seem happy with this card, and it seems to be a good option to choose if you have an excellent credit score. Additionally, Wells Fargo is a really big name in the banking industry so to have a card affiliated with that bank is a definite perks. After doing some research and looking at consumer reviews, this card definitely has benefits that outweigh its drawbacks and would be a good option for many people."},{"date":"2015-02-23","name":"Tatiana","user_id":"Ladykeoco","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Savings & CDs","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I love this saving account, I just opened one a few days ago and I always put money into it when ever I get it. and I know my money is safe with them and plus you get intrest with them which is also good. and its also easy for me to transfer my money from checking to saving just in case I have some extra money around that I don't wanna spend right away"},{"date":"2015-02-23","name":"Christina Fernandez","user_id":"cf333","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Savings & CDs","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"I really liked my Way2Save saving account before the new federal transfer limit of 6 transfers per month. Every time I use my Way2Save checking account (which is connected to the savings account), it puts $1 from my checking, into my savings account. This was no big deal before, because I could go online and transfer the money from my savings account back to my checking account, even if it was only for $1.00. Now I am more hesitant to do transfers, because the limit is imposed. I feel like I need to wait for a long time before I can transfer the money out of my savings account. This is annoying because I do not make a lot of money, and at times am strapped for cash, and therefore even a dollar would make a difference. The convenience of being able to do my transfers online or on the WellsFargo App on my phone is lost when limits are imposed. Also, there is this limit, because my account is free, which is why I gave it 3 stars. However, it's still a hassle. If the limit was not imposed, this savings account would receive 5 stars, but since there is a limit now, this savings account can be a little impractical.

The whole time I'm thinking I am protected from overdrafting my account but I was completely wrong. Long story short..... I overdrafted by a few cents two times and it ended up costing me an arm and a leg. I called Wells Fargo to ask them how that was possible with the overdraft protection and that's when they want to tell me that overdraft protection still doesn't prevent you from overdrafting your account. They are just another scam artist bank if you ask me!"},{"date":"2015-01-06","name":"Brandon Kaplan","user_id":"rocketmutt","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"After 2 years with Wells Fargo and this checking account, I can say officially it is the best setup I have ever had at a financial institution.

On one occasion, I mistakenly left my debit card in the ATM machine and as a safety precaution, the ATM ate it up. Within minutes of this happening, Wells Fargo sent me an email that I was able to conveniently check on my phone. I went back into the branch and not even 10 minutes later, an associate had already ordered me a new debit card and sent me on my way with a temporary card that linked up to my checking account.It was my mistake, but the way they treated me was with kindness and respect. The Way2Save feature of this checking account is very beneficial as well.

There are certain things that they went over with me about this type of checking rather than other types such as unlimited transfers to savings. When I walk into the bank and they pull that information up I am treated with the utmost respect. The teller spends more time with you, and they assist you more than other customers. They offer you things that they wouldn't offer standard customers. When I had a standard checking I didn't like the fees, and when more money rolled in they upgraded my account. The only thing I do not like about it is the balance you must keep in the account. For me, I must keep $1500 in checking, or I will succumb to fees.

I do wish they didn't have a non-bank ATM fee of $2.50; when I forget to take money out at the bank and have to use a non-Wells Fargo ATM, I usually end up paying $6.50 or more for that option because of their added fee (on top of the ATM fee). If you plan to withdraw money abroad, you definitely should look into other options, as they charge 3% AND a $5 fee for using a foreign ATM.

This card isn't like other cash rebates though, the rewards are deposited directly against your standing mortgage balance in $75 increments. Anyone who owns there own home knows how big of a deal this is because the first 5-6 years of paying a mortgage is mostly paying interest.

At the beginning it was amazing, seeing how I had a high credit limit and no interest fees for 6 months. But after the \"honeymoon\" so to speak, it became a bit of a battle. Purchases would take weeks to post to my card, and thus I never knew exactly how much credit I had left at any given time. Guessing would cause me to overdraft occasionally which was very frustrating. These days I've been able to use my card with few problems, but I never know when they will pop up again and cause my credit score to suffer. Hopefully this is just a personal issue, and not something many people deal with on the regular, but I figured it'd be good to share my opinion just in case it has happen to others.

It is a great way for someone with bad to fair credit improve their credit score because it requires you to open a collateral account, which they double to create your credit limit.  Add that to the fact that there aren't overdraft fees and the like, and you have what amounts to a very solid credit card.  Similar options by other banks will typically have not only higher APRs but also higher cash advance fees and rates as well.  And if you ever run into any issues, Wells Fargo has branches literally all over the country so an associate will be able to remedy the problem face to face, and that is something that gives me additional comfort especially considering a collateral account is required."},{"date":"2014-09-25","name":"Brian Ackroyd","user_id":"brian_ackroyd_3","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I opened a second checking account with Wells Fargo.

After that it is 5%. So, it's up to you but I'd be very very careful especially when considering a cash advance or transfer of funds to your checking account.  Transfers are also considered cash advance.  It's typical of banks but I don't like the way consumers are tricked into getting walloped if they take $20.00 out of an ATM.  Your best bet if you use the card is to use it only on transactions, don't use it at an ATM or go to the bank and take money out on it.  You will be unpleasently suprised.  It's great if you use it responsibly and pay off the balance each month.  Sorry, but I can give it no more than two stars.."},{"date":"2014-06-25","name":"Ashley Smith","user_id":"ashleynsmith30","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Savings & CDs","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I enjoy my WellsFargo savings account because it comes with additional features that allow me to save even if I don't always remember to.

Things got better when for about a year Wells Fargo offered me overdraft protection on my account by paying a monthly fee that would go towards overdraft fees.  Then out of nowhere, last November, I was charged an overdraft fee despite having the money for overdraft protection taken from my account.  After calling to speak with them, I had a rude customer service rep tell me that it was impossible for me to have overdraft protection on my checking account, despite my bank statements from previous months showing that I had never been charged when I had overdrafted.  This same rep then tried to rush me off and forward me to a credit card that I said I was not interested in.

The annual fee and absence of other fees are in line with more competitive credit card, but this is not a good option for anyone that can get a card.  You are paying them almost 19% and $25 a year to tell the credit bureaus you\u2019re paying on time, so you have to evaluate how much that is worth."},{"date":"2014-05-02","name":"Jen Lee","user_id":"jenlee8","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Savings & CDs","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I've had Wells Fargo savings account for many years.

I called them to see if it could be reversed since it was my first time, I was only overdrawn by $6, and I had the $6 in the account the next day, but all they would do is waive half of the overdraft fee; not particularly great customer service. However, I've stayed with them because they're right down the street and they have ATMs everywhere(and I must admit that I'm a fan of being able to deposit checks through the ATM).

I have nothing but good things to say about this bank.  I have a checking account with a debit card and Bill Pay and also a credit card.  Wells Fargo also handled my mortgage in 1996 when I was just sure no one would loan me money for a home!  When I initially set up my account it was through an in-store kiosk and the whole process took 5 minutes.  I had never had a  bank account before at that time, and they made the sign-up procedure very simple.  As a customer, I love the convenience of Bill Pay.  Nearly everyone allows you to pay bills online now, but when WF first started offering Bill Pay that was not the case.  If you do direct deposit and deposit $500 a month or more into your account there are no fees!  When I moved from Indiana to California it was so easy to get everything transferred over.  I didn't have to do a thing other than tell them I was moving and they noted the account to expect hotel and restaurant charges from out of the area.  For security measures, they normally confirm out of the area charges, which I really like.  It is a security measure to reduce fraud.  I've dealt with the bank before due to attempted fraud and they made the issues so easy to resolve because they do an outstanding job of protecting their customers.  Also, I've had a couple of incidences of non-sufficient funds and when I have contacted them and explained the circumstances, they waived all fees both times.  I highly recommend Wells Fargo.  Wells Fargo has a ton of branches just about everywhere and also lots of ATMs.  They are a solid, established bank that has been around for many decades and all indications are that they are not going anywhere.

Generally, I enjoy the bill pay option, ATM availability in my area, and relatively low fees compared to the other big banks.  I have also had a few issues with them.  In the most recent issue, I noticed an unauthorized $150 had been removed from my account at the end of the month, which overdrew me (for the first time), and it had overdraft fees assigned.  When I called them, they said I'd taken the money out with a deposit slip: an item I haven't used in years.  When I stated it was an invalid charge that needed to be investigated, while they did begin to look into it, the customer service was snippy, and despite it being my first overdraft, acted like she was doing me a favor by returning half the overdraft fee, which she stated \"they wouldn't normally do\".  When I followed up later, it turned out that they had accidentally switched the number from another customer's bank account, and at that point, apologized and corrected the remainder of the fee, but it was not great treatment.  I've also had issues with them cancelling a card due to a potential third party compromise, but neglected to inform me that my card wouldn't work.

They withdraw $25 every month and put it into my savings account. Another thing that I like is that in the event that you do need to take some money out of the way-to-save account, you can do so up to 6 times a month. A lot of other places don't offer this option. I believe you can withdraw again after the 6 times, but you will be charged a small fee.

I also think that if Wells Fargo is truly interested in assisting people with rebuilding their credit, then Wells Fargo would explain to these types of people that if they have enough liquid cash on hand to provide a security deposit, then they should just use that cash to make purchases without relying on credit.

The customer service is more than reasonable as well, there was actually an error on an item being overcharged and the balance was replenished in my account before anything.

I am happy with this account.  It is great for people who have extra money at the end of the month and want to start saving.  Every month when I am paid, $25 is taken out of my direct deposit into my checking account and put into my savings account.  Also, every time I use my checking account's debit card, $1 is transferred into my savings account.  This was great when my income was higher, but now it is often a burden to transfer the funds back to my checking, because I can't afford to save since my pension was severely cut.

There is a federal limit of how many withdrawals the bank can allow you to make from a savings account and they are very clear up front in letting you know what that amount is per month, I believe it is 6 or 7 withdrawals.

You can get so much more out of your shopping with this card. You can't earn points like this with your other cards that aren't from Dillard's, you can earn 2 Dillard's Reward Points per one dollar spent at Dillard's and that is huge, and even more you can earn 2 Dillard's Reward Points per one dollar spent at grocery stores and gas stations when you use your Dillard's American Express Card. So you will be racking the points up like no one's business. Be sure when you open your account that it's a day you plan on spending some money because you get some great opportunities on that day that i have never seen from another card. Automatically receive a bonus 10% Off All-Day Welcome Shopping Pass in your first statement when you spend just $100 the day you open your account. That's just crazy! With all the points you're earning you can get more 10% off times if you miss out on this one, because you can earn points toward 10% off Shopping Passes or earn points toward $10 Rewards Certificates that you can use on all Dillard's Merchandise.

First off is the interest rates. With my Amex card there is only a maximum potential of a 22% rate. For the Wells Fargo card it goes up to 26%. It's unlikely that would be my or your rate, but it's something to keep in mind.Next is rewards. With my Amex card it is strictly cash back and I can earn up to 6% back when I use it at the grocery store, 3% for gas and 1% for everything else. the Wells Fargo card works on a point system, but I feel they win in this category because they have a lot more variety in rewards including airfare, cash, and merchandise. Maximum possible points is 5 points per $1 for the  first six moths. After the intro period it goes to 1 point per $1.I really love my Amex blue cash card, but I'm seriously considering switching over. The Wells Fargo card seems pretty solid and it comes with more benefits than the Amex card. It is also a Visa card, so technically it should be accepted more places than my Amex card. Though, its been pretty rare when Amex isn't accepted. Still that is a definite plus for the future.For the big spender, I would recommend the Wells Fargo Rewards Credit Card, but if you only spend things on the necessities, I would recommend the American Express Blue Cash Preferred Card for the straight cash backVery solid card from Wells Fargo with really great rewards and points system, but be careful with some of the rates, Make sure to pay your balance!"},{"date":"2013-12-11","name":"derrick dawkins","user_id":"ezdzd","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"The Wells Fargo Secured Card is a great way to electronically pay your bills and make online purchases.

Still, if you aren't as fortunate as some you could be looking at a rate as high as 26% which is quite high and would send me looking elsewhere for a credit card.  The real meat and potatoes of this card is the reward system and since I don't have a card with a great rewards plan I wanted to look further into this card. The first 6 months you can really stack up points earning 5 for every $1 spent at select stores. After that you drop to a 1 for $1 ratio. I went to the store to see what you can get for your points. They have, for example, a gift certificate to AMC (movie theaters) for $25 that costs 2250 points. Using this one example, I would have to spend $2,250 to be able to purchase a $25 gift card to the movie theater. That is a 0.01% return on your spending (which is pretty low compared to the savings you can get with other reward cards).An Acer 7\" 8 GB tablet would cost a bit over 25,000 points (and would require you spending $25k on your credit card to rack up at the regular rate). To their credit they do have a wide number of interesting rewards and getting a reward is better than getting nothing. Still, reward rates like this are so low most it would take most people quite awhile to accumulate enough points to be able to redeem them for any decent items. There are some cards that offer instant savings on your purchase and I personally would rather have one of them than one that has a reward system such as this. If you just want it because you qualify for a decent rate and accumulating the points is just a nice bonus for you, this card really isn't too bad.

This is a fine account if you always depositing a steady pay check into it but at the time I had the account I was only able to maintain contract and temporary work. If you aren't able to place $500 dollars in the account via direct deposit each month or maintain a balance of $1500 then you will get charged $7 a month. I was unable to do this and was getting paid in cash. I wound up having a low balance and no direct deposits placed into the account for nearly 5 months. They closed the account on me and charged me $50. So, if you have steady income or don't mind paying $7 a month (not to mention a $2 paper statement fee that I didn't care for) then it would be a decent checking account for you. I did find that they have top-notch customer service when I lost my debit card. I also enjoyed the many different locations they have in my area. They have very nice ATM machines that make it easy to make deposits as well. I think for people with steady income this is a fine account if you don't mind the fees."},{"date":"2013-11-08","name":"Missy Johnson-Trimble","user_id":"missy_trimble","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"The interest rate is frightening but we did get one for our daughter before she went off to school.

It gives you more bang for your buck as the reward program is great.  You get 1 point for every $1 spent and 5 reward points for every $1 spent on groceries, gas and drugstore purchases.  There is so much you can do with your reward points, but the things I do most with them is use them for travel.  They offer travel rewards without blackout dates which is important.  What good are travel rewards if you can't use them when you are available to travel?  A similar card is the Sony Card from Capital One.  The problem there is you can only earn 5 rewards per $1 if you spend money at the Sony store.  Personally I buy more groceries than I do Sony products.  I'd also rather spend my money on travel, hotels, and car rentals as opposed to being forced to use them on Sony merchandise.  The Wells Fargo Rewards Credit Card is great.  It protects your card from theft with it's Zero liability program and gives you all the great benefits you deserve from Visa.

With 2 kids who are going through growth spurts, I am spending a lot on groceries early on, so I am building points quick, I have had the card for three months and am quite pleased with my accrued points to this point, I haven\u2019t fully looked through my options for rewards, but I did notice a bunch of cash and prepaid store cards on the list, so I know soon, I will be getting something.  Good card, be aware of the points limits and cut off dates on some of the point building features.

Most in store cards, JC Penny, Belk, and TJ Max for example, have an APR around 25%. The Dillards card has a variable rate between 13.99-21.99. More reasonable in my opinion. I also like the rewards system better than most other store cards. Not only do you earn 2 rewards points for every dollar you spend at Dillards, but also when you buy gas and groceries. It is nice to get rewards points for essentials. The TJ Max card offers only one reward point for every dollar spent outside the store, but does give you 5 points for in store dollars. The APR is pretty high at 26.99 though.  On both the Dillards and TJ Max cards you get 10% off the first day of shopping upon signing up. With the Belk card you get 15% off. Frankly, getting a percentage off the first day of shopping doesn't really sweeten the deal for me that much.

Best part is there's no redeem limit whereas with my Bank of America World Points Rewards card, the points do eventually expire. I love that they give a 10% discount. Combine that with the post-winter holiday sales (in January) and you can get an incredible deal on your purchase! The only thing that I don't like is that there is no intro rate. This is really the best part of switching to a new credit card, especially if you want to transfer a balance over that you can pay off over time without accruing interest at the same time. If you're opening a brand new account, this seems like a great option if you can get the lower interest rate (13.24%) that they offer. All in all, this card is a great option if it works for you.

I don't think this card stacks up to the best cards of this variety, however. The American Express Blue Cash Preferred, for starters, offers 6% back on groceries, which the WF card cannot compete with. The Chase Freedom card, which offers 5% cash back in rotating categories, is also a better option. Be mindful that these other cards also offer great sign-up bonuses, which the WF Rewards does not.

It also offered good call center customer service, and online help. Then some evil emperor must have taken over from the shadows of the planets of over-commercialism and over-cost cutting in the name of Wells Fargo. The whole system started to break down.The checking account I had with Wells Fargo had been mine for over twenty years and had seen three changes of bank ownership in those twenty years - Georgia Federal to First Union,to Wachovia to Wells Fargo. Never had I been charged fees for my checking account, or expected to maintain a minimum balance, free checking was free checking. Then, Wells Fargo took over. within a year, I was charged minimum account balance fees. The cost of such items as money orders, that had been a fee free part of being a customer of the bank, now turned out to be more expensive than going to Western Union or the Post Office. Online customer service became hard to navigate. Call center customer service put you on hold forever...The worst thing that happened was, that, after more than twenty years of holding onto this account with no other names on it, Wells Fargo decided not to treat me as the primary account holder when I added my husband to it. The first time my debit card expired, they re-issued current cards and gave my husband a whopping $4,000 dollar greater limit on total daily withdrawal than me. When I asked about this, noone could tell me why, and noone was willing to fix it. It didn't even matter to them that I could prove that I was the only one putting money into the account for a long as I had been.The most pleasant part of customer service was when I went back to the original state and original branch that my account had been at, and closed it. The bank manager there was very helpful, non-confrontational, and apologetic for the service, or lack thereof, that I had received.

I've never had any problem with hidden fees. And as far as my branch goes, whenever fees do pop up, they are quick to tell me and get me with a banker to help waive them. They all know who I am, and greet me by name. Online banking is a plus, although I wish they could take checks through the app like chase can. My one problem is crazy long lines on Fridays, but I can't blame them it's payday. Never had to wait when I go on any other day though. Overall although there interest rates suck, they are still the only bank I would consider for checking accounts and mortgage. As far as credit cards go there okay, I have the 1% cash back and pay in full. Stay away for savings if you have a credit union near by.

The customer service I have received since then at my local Wells Fargo has been amazing! The clerks with whom I get the pleasure to associate with are always very friendly and never seem to absolutely hate their job, like most people now a days. The representatives I have spoken to over the phone have been just as delightful. I love the fact that if your account goes into the negative and you manage to balance it out within a day, they will refund the whole overdraw fee. That has saved my butt a couple of times! I also really love the fact that if you have a monthly direct deposit linked to your checking account, they will give you a credit of $500 in case of an emergency (though it is something you must pay back, if you use that money.) Since I currently do not have a credit card, knowing that I have that extra money, in case of an emergency, makes me feel more secure!

The cash back credit card is nice for the first 6 months, when you get 3% rewards, but then it drops down to 1%, which is better than nothing, but not as good as some other cards. I have a couple of other cards that pay 2% constantly, so I'll quit using the Wells Fargo card as soon as the 3% deal is over, and keep it for emergencies. As long as there isn't an annual fee, I figured getting 3% back was better than 2%. I mean, that's how they get us, right? Nickel and dime us with a % here, and a % there; so that's what I want to do, too. If I can get an extra % out of them, for 6 months, I'll take it. I pay the purchases every month, and if I can't pay for it I don't buy it. SO the ridiculous interest rate doesn't matter to me. You'd think that in a time when the Federal Reserve is driving interest rates into the gutter, that credit card rates would be a bit lower too, but no. I haven't had any problems with the card or the service from Wells Fargo.

Another member of the organization had accidentally overdrawn the account, thinking that a check had already been deposited by the treasurer.

And they were always cheerful. Honestly though, after a few months I was less than positive about my account. Hidden fees... every statement that came in had one fee after another. I spent a good deal of time talking to the young lady who sat down with me to start my account. We went over all the paperwork and I left feeling that my work account was in good hands. I guess I needed a couple more hours of her time to go through all the small print hidden between the lines. Well Fargo made it insanely easy to start an account.

I deferred payments on the loan for several years because I was in school. However, even though I was not making payments during the deferment period, that period still counted toward the total amount of time I had to pay back my loan, which was not explained to me. Once I began working and started repayment, my minimum payment was increased to nearly 800 dollars a month, as the term of the loan had been decreased substantially. When I ran into trouble making my payments, I contacted Wells Fargo and asked them for help consolidating the loan or changing the payment plan. They told me flat out that they could not help me in any way. I sucked it up, made partial payments until I could afford to make the full payment, and took the credit hit. I finally paid off the loan, but I remain unimpressed with the fact that Wells Fargo was unwilling to work with me in any way.

So far, the hassle of switching banks has outweighed the negatives of staying with Wells Fargo, but it looks like the point at which that reverses is swiftly approaching.When I first opened a linked checking and savings account, I had a steadily paying job and a consistent paycheck being directly deposited twice a month. I was assured that I would never have to pay any fees and that through depositing $75 dollars a month from my checking to my savings, it would stay that way. Well, a year later, no longer employed, I start receiving monthly services fees on my account out of the blue. It turns out there was a minimum direct deposit amount that was a required to maintain the fee waiver. I went to my branch and explained to them that I was never told this, and they offered to refund the fees and rearrange the account so that I would not be assessed any further charges. They could only refund some of the fees, though, so I did end up losing some money, but at least I didn't have to worry about fees anymore.Wrong! The same thing happened again six months later, and I went back to the branch and they again offered to refund the fees, but wait! Policy had changed and they were no longer allowed to do that. They did set me up with a new account without fees, however, as long as I use my debit card for a certain number of purchases a month. The hidden fees are annoying, the constantly shifting requirements for avoiding them are outrageous, and I am tired of playing this game.

I heard really positive things about Wells Fargo so I decided to try them out.At first, I was a little apprehensive about joining them. The branch I went to was in Pineville, NC and was a little pushy with their sales. I understand the whole process about trying the sale numerous times, but I was in a rush and felt a little pressured to join. I repeatedly offered to take her business card and come back another day and she kept pushing me to give her my license and social security number to get me set up. I ended up leaving without opening an account that day and coming back a couple weeks later to speak with someone else who wasn't pushy at all. I am glad I went back because I really like their banking policies.I am also not fond of monthly fees when it comes to bank accounts and with Wells Fargo, as long as you use your debit card 10 times a month, there is no monthly fee. I probably use my card 90 times a month so it wasn't an issue to me.Their customer service is great.

The things I don't like are trying to be sold on services I don't want or need, and the checking fees. I don't have any fees but that is only because my home loan is with them. I feel like I am sort of tied to them for services in that regard. If I go anywhere else I will have checking fees. Overall, everything is just OK. They haven't been bad to me at all as a local branch, and they are always helpful and greet me. I've refinanced with them in the past and it was a slow process with many papers being asked for multiple times. The second time I refinanced for a lower rate years later was much quicker and easier due to a streamlined process, but not everyone is eligible for that."},{"date":"2013-03-14","name":"Kjell","user_id":"kjellped","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"I have been with Wells Fargo as a checking customer since 2001.

I have been charged fees that I felt were unfair, and had some money I felt was held too long after the deposit was made without me having access to it. I think I would encounter similar problems at any major bank. But when I have had problems, I spoke with a teller and they were able to resolve them every time without hassle.

You call the number and the automated service is not much help.  When you finally get someone on the line it is often in the wrong department and you are on hold forever.

However, the customer service via phone can be rather lacking. They seem experienced, but not as friendly as when I go to the branch for assistance. They are not as knowledgeable as the branch representatives when it comes to questions about joint accounts. For example, last week I called to find out what I would need to do to take a name off of my joint account, and add another person to it. They told me all I would have to do was go into the branch and add the new person without removing the other. When I went into the branch, I was told that I would have to completely close my account out, and open a new one to remove the name on it, and to add the person to my account, I would have to have the person I am trying to remove to agree to add the other person. It was very confusing and not what I had been told by the phone representative. Luckily we managed to fix the issue at hand without having to involve everyone at one time, and it took about an hour to open a new account in the branch, whereas I do not remember it taking that much time online.

I had a terrible time with Wachovia. Due to identity theft, they released every penny in my checking account to an \u201cofficer of the court\u201d to satisfy a settlement entered against me, that I had absolutely no idea about. No bill collectors, no statements, no court paperwork, nothing. It was all sent to the fraudulent address the imposter had furnished to apply for (and default on) a credit card. Wachovia didn't even notify me that they had released all my money. My paycheck was auto-deposited, immediately released to the \u201ccourt\u201d, and then Wachovia continued to allow me to use my debit card for a week and a half before denying me a fill up at the gas station one day. Needless to say, I was devastated when I attempted to find out why. At that point I was -$600.00 from online bill pays and -$250 from Wachovia fees. (They charged me $100.00 for the inconvenience of having to give my money to someone else.) I was told it would be at least a year before anything could be done about the identity theft and I could get some recovery, but in the meantime I would continue to incur penalties over the $850.00 overdraft. I managed to broker with Wachovia to waive the penalties and paid them back the $600.00 principal. I then closed my account and opened one again in another local bank. No problems. A year later I decided to move to Oregon. The new bank I had chosen didn't have branch offices on the west coast so I needed to transfer my funds to a new bank. I tried the closest one to my home, Umpqua and was rejected. Rejected?? I'd never heard of such a thing, they rejected my application to open a checking account. I was informed that because I had an outstanding debt with Wachovia that I had been put on some awful \u201cBanking blacklist\u201d that could follow me up to TEN YEARS or until Wachovia removed me from the list. Astonished, I called Wachovia over and over and over to try to figure out what was going on. As far as I knew my account with them had been satisfied and closed. I even had a case number. By this point, however, Wachovia was gone, absorbed by Wells Fargo. So... to make a long story even longer, I went to Wells Fargo and sat down with a financial adviser. After relaying my story he made several calls to banking entities that aren't even available to the general public to try to figure out what I \u201cowed\u201d Wachovia and what I could do to satisfy the debt. After 2 solid hours on the phone he finally gave up. Wachovia was no-more. My name is on a debtors list but there is no account information attached to my name or SSN, so nobody can figure out what I owe who or why, and since Wachovia destroyed any possibility of me being able to do banking ANYWHERE for the next 10 YEARS, they would have to be the ones to release my name from the list, and because they were gone, they couldn't, and nothing can be done for me. Sweet, right? So, I think out of pure pity Wells Fargo decided to give me a probationary checking account which I rolled-over into a regular checking account after the 6 month probationary period. Wells Fargo has been ok. They keep instituting new weird rules about how many times I have to use my debit card and they are often the target of scams so I have to keep on my toes and watch my account like a hawk. Other than that, I enjoy the online banking. I've never had trouble depositing checks through the ATM (which is really handy) and my basic banking needs are met. However, I have no other choices at this point, or may not for the next 8 years, so, Wells Fargo it is. (I do have joint accounts with my husband at two other credit unions, but I had to go through a lengthy appeal process and my access to those accounts is very limited. I could not open an account at either on my own.)"},{"date":"2013-02-27","name":"Devon Miller","user_id":"DevonMiller527","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Car Loans","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I had been with Wells Fargo since college but left because they got bought out.

That's the one down side about this card, which I have not yet experienced and don't plan on experiencing, but if you don't pay your credit card bills on time, the late fees will get you pretty harshly.

The only part of the process that was smooth during my entire five year relationship with them was the initial application. Unfortunately, that is because the contract turned out to be riddled with deceit. Fine print is buried to negate every positive guarantee that they make; however, this is not even the bulk of the true nature of my grievances. I paid close attention to the details but what they do not inform you of is that they can change these details on a whim without any notice. All of a sudden, Free Checking is gone, Overdraft Protection requires exorbitant expenditure, and fees are constantly added and hidden into the mechanisms of every day financial activities. Soon, online banking and transfer services cost extra. They overdraft us with surprise fees and then use that as an excuse to take more money. Trying to resolve this problem was impossible, as the customer service professionals down the line were vapid and incapable of doing anything more than reading along with you.

As a college student, I struggled to save money. The encouragement and friendly service given to me by the staff made me feel like I was at a local bank rather than a large bank. The staff truly was the best. While there were problems at the beginning of my time using Wells Fargo, mostly because of the switch the bank was going through from Wachovia to Wells Fargo, the staff made it all worthwhile. Wells Fargo has since got everything under control and I couldn't be happier with my experience. When I had to go to Europe this past summer, I needed to exchange currencies. There is at least one Wells Fargo in every city that has foreign currency on hand, ready for exchange. This convenience is truly appreciated.

I had been transferring cash from my checking to my PayPal account, but had made sure I was within my budget. I was very confused.

I called the customer service number and they informed me that there is an online transfer limit. I was never informed of this, and could not find anything in my paperwork. I asked why all of the fees had shown up simultaneously, and the woman informed me that they hadn't. They were clearly charged all in one night, as reflected in my statements. She said there was nothing I could do other than pay. I did some research online and found out that many other people had suffered the same issue. Strangely enough, all of them were between the ages of 18-21, and all were college students. I felt as though we were being taken advantage of, so I dug further. I found that FDIC law states that an account holder cannot be charged over 7 times without notification. I presented this information to their customer service department, and they said they would get back to me. Nobody every reached me, and every time I called they told me they would call back.

It is hard to find any information on how to redeem, and in the end you have to call in to redeem, unlike most others where you can do this online. Their checking accounts are a good service, and I can always find a branch or ATM if needed."},{"date":"2013-01-18","name":"Lauren Edwards","user_id":"lauren_edwards_7528","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"I have used Wells Fargo in the past, and I thought I got average service.

They always try to sell me something like a checking account, health savings account, or an individual retirement account. I would never open a checking account there because it is very expensive.

However, there have been issues that have come up that did not make me particularly ecstatic. For example, I wrote a check to the local court for a speeding ticket, and I wrote an amount for more than the bail amount. Someone at the court changed the amount without informing me, so when I noticed something strange in my banking activity, I went to my local branch. The manager printed a copy and confirmed that someone wrote on my check a different amount than what I had signed for. She told me there was nothing they could do, and even said to me that I shouldn't even bother calling because \u201cit's not like they wrote in more than you signed for.\u201d I guess I felt it wasn't handled professionally, and that my bank should be more on top of things like this. It did make me feel a bit uneasy.I can also say that the customer service has declined over the last few years.

Once I didn't have enough in the account to cover the bill payment, it was put through. I have a credit union now, and the payment is done and processed the next day, so the phone company is not at fault. And of course the customer service helps you with none of the extra charges.

In the grand scheme of things, I'd have to rate them as a good bank. Whenever I call to speak with a CSR, I'm always greeted warmly. They also provide great information and prompt service over the phone. The only problem I have with them is the fact that it often takes an incredible long time when I visit a branch. Doesn't matter if I'm going to a teller, or if I'm looking to speak with a banker. For example, just recently I visited the branch because I needed some forms notarized. It took over an hour just to sit down with a banker. Now to be fair, there were a few people ahead of me, but still, I can't fathom why it took over an hour just to notarize two forms. So yes, despite, the long lines, I'd rate them as a good bank. A great bank would remove the fees associated with a basic checking account.

You have to dispute everything and it takes a while to get to someone who will actually help you. Their email and phone line services give you the runaround and do not really answer your questions. Last year, I was informed that my free checking account would now have a monthly fee, unless certain stipulations were met, like a minimum balance or qualifying direct deposit. I immediately inquired whether or not my direct deposit would qualify, and I was told that it would not. I asked 3 or 4 times why it did not qualify, seeing as I had worked at a reputable and very large state funded organization for four years, but no one could ever tell me why.

I think the bank has it set up wanting you to get late payments. I think this for two reasons. First, Wells Fargo has very limited options for making payments that are inconvenient. You can\u2019t use an ATM to make a payment, so if you want to pay your bill with cash then you have to do it way ahead of your due date to make sure they have time to process the payment.  If you are willing to give the bank monthly fees and open a checking or savings account, then I guess this ATM issue isn\u2019t going to be a problem for you because you can deposit in the bank account and pay the credit card\u2019s bill the same day with your bank account. The second reason I think they have rules set up to make late payments is that there have been times that I tried to make my payment online with them, and they would not let me pay with my outside bank. There is a little drop down box on the payments page, and several times my outside bank has disappeared from the payment sources options."},{"date":"2012-12-07","name":"Jason","user_id":"Jason1987","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Student Loans","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"When it was time for me to get my student loans for college I went to Wells Fargo only because my parents already had accounts there.

Recently we needed to withdraw money from an out of state money managed account, credit card as we needed it to help rent my daughter a house. First we went to Suntrust and they were unable to do it for unknown reasons. We decided to try Wells Fargo, since she has an active account there as well. When we arrived it was almost closing time on a Thursday, so we were worried they'd close before we could see a teller. We managed to be seen before closing and couldn't have had better service. Not only did they make the cash advance on the spot, but they also helped us convert it into 2 money orders to give the property manager. All of this was done for NO CHARGE. Because of their willingness to help us at closing time above and beyond what we expected, my daughter was able to get a lovely rental house, in the nick of time, before someone else rented it.

When I spoke with the customer service representative about it, their attitude seemed to convey that they could care less whether or not they retained me as a customer. This spoke volumes to me. In addition to that, if I wrote a check to a friend, Wells Fargo charged $5 to cash it, and then has the nerve to ask that person to become a customer of Wells Fargo.

No problems there. However, they increased it a few months ago to $1500. Not a big deal, but I got hit with a $15 fee because they did not notify me in time, and I was unable to get the minimum balance in time.My least favorite part has been their service in the banks. Some of the employees are helpful, but many are not. One time I went in to deposit $400 in coins and the teller looked at me like I was crazy. I had it rolled and everything, but they did not seem to understand that people might actually deposit coins. They eventually got everything done, but I had to wait nearly a half hour.

I started banking with Wells Fargo because I anticipated moving around a lot, and I wanted to be able to keep the same bank everywhere I went. But I'm realizing now that it's far more important to keep your money somewhere that cares about you; Wells Fargo has done many things that indicate that they don't. For example, they allow you to overdraft rather than simply declining your transaction, and they deliberately structure their withdrawal attempts (largest first) so that you overdraft as many times as possible; then they charge you $35 per overdraft. If you get overdraft protection, it still costs you $12.50 every time you do it, and they still do the largest first so they can charge you. Such tactics make it clear that they're not grateful to be able to hold on to my money and invest it, which would be a mutually beneficial scenario; they want to take as much more of it as they can.

The only annoyances I have are the fact that they weren't really willing to work with me when I wanted to refinance my home - I ended up going with a mortgage through a whole other bank altogether. Also, their clerks when you go into a branch can be a little weird. Their customer service is friendly no doubt, but also arguably kind of nosy. They ask what I'm doing today, and things like that. It's just kind of a weird cultural element to this bank, but nothing that should make a decision for you."},{"date":"2012-11-19","name":"jason buonomo","user_id":"chicago17","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Mortgages","review_comment":false,"stars":1,"review":"I opened a home mortgage account with Wells Fargo in 2005.

Any type of bank makes a lot of money just from you swiping your car or having money in your account, why do they have to charge a monthly fee? I don't have to pay a monthly fee to keep my money in a mattress so I should have to pay a monthly fee to store money at a bank.

I remember walking in to one of their local branches here in Arizona when I was 18 and feeling like I was finally going to be an adult. I had all of the hopes and aspirations a young person has and now I was really going to be somebody! I was going to have a checking account! The application was pretty straight forwards. I met with a banker and they asked for my information and I had an account within minutes. No problems, no struggles, it was simple. Unfortunately, that was about the only simple thing that came from this experience. Wells Fargo crushed those teenage dreams and aspirations quickly with their seemingly hidden fees and cash grabs. At this time, I was still learning how to budget and their (then) $25 NSF fees would seem to hit my account harder as they would clear the largest items first on my account while charging the smaller ones later, no matter what order I charged them. At the time I was making $6.25 an hour and couldn't afford the fees much longer. Within 6 months I had already paid at least $125 in NSF fees and decided it was enough before switching to Chase bank. Walking in to a branch made me feel as if I was nothing more than a bag of flesh with a big dollar sign on my forehead to the tellers and the service would decrease once they saw I was not signing up for another credit card or a loan.

When I opened my account they were known as Wachovia and had several branches around my local area which persuaded me to open an account and bank with them. I opened my account with checking and savings in mind which was very misleading to say the least. When Wells Fargo was Wachovia, they were a really good bank that I could rely on and was very customer friendly but since they changed to Wells Fargo they have made a complete turn around for the worse.I was told that putting money from my checking to my savings would be a $5 fee, but depositing money straight into my savings account would prevent this which ended up not being the case at all. I was charged a $5 fee regardless of if I deposited my money into my checking or directly into savings. Any time I addressed this issue I was told that what happened was pretty much working as intended and offered no clear resolution to my problem.I ended up closing both my checking savings account due to constant $1 fee charges whenever I used my card; an obvious grab for money that hit my wallet pretty hard over time. Apparently Wells Fargo didn't approve of me closing my account and claimed they were dropping me before I called them to close my account, I just \"have not received the notification yet\". A $25 coverage fee was charged upon closing my account while also taking the rest of my money that was in the account as well (a whopping total of $21.75). I shutter to think how many people got hit by Wells Fargo over the years but I have asked around locally and apparently this is anything but a rare occasion.

With plenty of financial institutions out there, I randomly chose Wells Fargo for my student loans. The application was fairly easy to complete, but I have had my fair share of problems. My private college takes payment very seriously. For some reason, Wells Fargo often distributes my payments late. After numerous complaints and attempts to fix this behavior, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve yet to see much of a resolution. When my payments weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t late, the remainder of the loan often took weeks to reach my checking account. This was money I needed to cover odds and ends.

Sadly the only rewards worth going for tend to be the gift cards. Typically I'll redeem the Amazon digital certificates. - I often shop on-line and find this one just as good as cash. Sadly the direct 'redeem for credit' to your account costs more points than the gift cards, so I've never used it. As far as customer service goes, I've had this card stolen twice now.

It took over two weeks to get a bank draft from the UK sorted, I was told several different fees by different employees and the rules and regulations seemed to change with each new person I talked to.

The thing that really gets me is I go \"Shoot, what do I do?\", so I call the customer care hotline. I explain what is going on, which ATM I deposited at, etc., and the representative credits my account for the full amount at that instant.The thing is, I checked my balance that afternoon and everything was fine. But I think the next day or so I check my balance again and I'm credited the full amount of the deposit, listing that ATM location, and I'm really confused.

The only thing that bothers me about this bank is probably the fact that their online banking insists on bombarding you with information about services they'd LOVE for you to try almost every time you log in, but in my opinion the good outweighs the bad."},{"date":"2012-07-24","name":"Todd Landerson","user_id":"landers","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Credit Cards","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I have been a Wells Fargo customer for over 6 years now and my primary credit card has been through them the whole time.

I pay about $17\/year for the program and usually earn several hundred dollars a year in cash credits to my account. On one occasion I accidentally took a cash advance on my card which I didn't want - one phone call and a representative quickly reversed it without charge.

There were a couple of times that they wouldn't let me deposit it a check with out a parent even though the previous times a parent wasn't required, which amounts to that the workers either didn't want to deal with it or that they weren't trained properly. Secondly when I did withdraw money, (which I did once in like two months) they wouldn't let me with out three forms of I.D. I found that ridiculous.

I have always found the customer service to be decent, nothing exceptional but nothing horrendous.  I don't recall having any issues with them. Since they were acquired by Wells Fargo, we continued to bank with them. However, they recently imposed a fee for not having at least one direct deposit or minimum balance maintained. This fee is $5. I don't feel a basic checking account should have such fees associated with them, especially when there are other banks that don't require this.

On a more positive note, I must say that all the employees that I have encountered have been very friendly and polite and show genuine interest in college students having their accounts with Wells Fargo. The application is not complicated nor does it take a very long time. I like that there is at least an account type available specifically for college students, although I am not convinced that it is the best option out there.

However, I have had no issues with Wells Fargo and truly enjoy the benefits of being with a large bank that has branches throughout the United States.   My husband also has a business checking account with Wells Fargo, and I love it that we can connect all of our accounts together with just one login for online banking.  I also like their new feature where you can send money out to anyone, or anyone can send money to you through text message or email.  Customer support is available via phone 24 hours a day, and I also like that I can go almost anywhere within the United States and still find a Wells Fargo.  With smaller banks, I always hated that I had to call them to increase the spending limits on my Visa\/Mastercard debit cards because I could not go to a nearby bank to pull out additional money.  The only thing that is a little annoying is the fact that sometimes tellers will try to sell me a bank offer (such as life insurance or a new credit card).  They usually stop when I tell them I am not interested, but there have been a few stubborn ones who have tried calling me after I have left the bank location.

That being said, it's always difficult to suddenly be working with an institution you didn't choose. I chose to bank with Wachovia...but my experiences with Wells Fargo have been largely good. The availability of ATMs is more with Wells Fargo, which is very convenient. I especially appreciate the ability to deposit checks at ATMs without envelopes and get the check image printed on the receipt for record keeping. This virtually eliminates my trips to the bank as I can direct deposit my paycheck and deposit anything I need at any ATM, without worrying that they will be out of envelopes. My only complaint is that I found out recently that Wells Fargo charges me when someone writes me a bad check. I always understood that if a person wrote a check and didn't have the money to cover it, they would be responsible for the fees involved (not the innocent check acceptor). But sure enough, the one time recently it happened I was charged a fee. That accounts for the minus one star because that just seems unfair. However, when I called the customer service line I was given a \"courtesy\" waive of half of the fee, which did show some effort to compromise and resolve the problem and in the end left me satisfied overall."},{"date":"2012-07-10","name":"Ashley Walls","user_id":"aw2250","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":3,"review":"When I first moved away to go to college, I opened a checking account at a Wachovia Bank.

Great if you have an unexpected expense, like car troubles. They charge a relatively nominal fee ($1.50 per every $20) and even allow you to pay it back over time so you don't find yourself penniless come next paycheck.I've never had to wait too long on the phone, though I rarely need to call them.

I regularly use a wide variety of their services to include direct deposit, online banking, online bill pay, and even getting cashier's checks from local branches to make payments occasionally.  My problems with Wells Fargo have been very minimal and I can't really complain about anything other than their abysmal interest rates for savings account.  Because interest rates are so low, I keep most of my savings with an online bank that has higher rates.  This method isn't shocking to anybody that's financially savvy, though.  What I like about Wells Fargo is how good they are about problem resolution and customer service.  Any time there has been any type of issue at all, no matter how minor, I know that I'll get a friendly, results-oriented response from Wells Fargo when I call.  Here's a great example.  A few weeks ago someone wrote me a bad check.  WF charged me a small fee for the check bouncing.  I was broke at the time.  I literally had less than $10 in my checking account and could not afford to pay even a $12 fee if I wanted to eat that day.  So I called WF and explained the situation, and they waived half of the fee.  I was eventually able to collect the rest from the party who had written the bad check in the first place, so it all worked out. Wells Fargo has always been more than satisfactory.

You can apply online and have the security deposit debited directly from your Wells Fargo checking or savings account.

Our first per-approval fell through and Wells came through for us and gave us the loan.  Since then we have had problems with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage to the point in which we almost lost our home.  We went through the home modification process and at the end they wanted the total amount of $2300 in a matter of three days.  We were denied three times for the modification, one denial was because we sent our payments during the probation period in early, another was denied because our debt monthly was too high, and third because we had $50 left over.  For a year we fought with Wells, filed bankruptcy and in the end dropped the bankruptcy, refinanced  with Wells and then I received a bill for $400 because of filing bankruptcy.  With the refinance we paid them $1400 to cover all fees.  When I question this additional $400 no one can tell me what it is for.  Now we missed a month's payment because of recent changes in our payrolls.  When I contacted Wells to make payment arrangements, they wanted $600 for three months.  I informed them that was not a good plan for us, we were told that is all they could do.  So now we are paying what we can all the while Wells Fargo is sending us letters stating the money is due in one day.  They do not seem to want to help us save our house or work with us in anyway.  If I could, I would get out of this loan with them, but because of all the issues with them, our credit is shot and we can't get a new loan right now.  The people I talk to are polite but of no help.  They have even sent over a person to take pictures of our home to verify we live there.  I have informed them several times and has been noted in my account that we are paying what we can, when we can on the past due amount that is only one month.

But, for the most part I have been very happy with Wells Fargo.Customer Service:Wells Fargo has very good customer service in my opinion.  Whenever I need to discuss something with my banker, he usually always finds time and can see me within 3 days.  On top of that if he can't see me, he always has someone who works at Wells Fargo that he can recommend.  They also have 24 hour phone support which I have used several times to dispute charges.Clear Disclosures:I really feel like that Wells Fargo did not let me know about everything I could be charged, and were incorrect on a few occasions.  They changed the minimum balances in my checking accounts with out telling me and then hit me with a 35 dollar fee.  On top of this, they hit me with an \"Excessive Activity Fee\" after a few online transfers, charging me a total of 45 dollars.  Again, they told me that I was allowed as many as I wanted.Applications Process:The process was very easy.  It was a while ago, so I'm not sure if there was a minimum balance, but it only took 15-30 minutes.Problem Resolution:This is where I feel they are the best bank.  Whenever I have a problem and I call their customer service, they always have a very easy solution for me.  Also, when I asked about the charges that I mention in my \"Clear Disclosures\" section, they immediately told why and then said they would reverse them for me.Over all 8\/10; would bank again."},{"date":"2012-06-25","name":"Chelsea Ray","user_id":"chelsea_ray","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":5,"review":"I have been a Wells Fargo customer for a very long time, but only started using it for myself maybe five years ago.

They also had them in New York, where I visited and was able to deposit and take out money as I needed. Millions of people also have this bank, so I know I'm not alone. I like the thought of a national bank because I feel like I can trust it more. Also, their overdraft protection, bill-pay, and online services are phenomenal. They have an iPhone and Android app - I have used both, and they're simple and easy to use. Customer-service wise, I have never had any problems with them and they have always resolved my problems concisely.

I had poor credit before I even got this card and this was my first card  (other debt was the cause of my poor credit).  I now have good credit and a lot of that is due to proper use of my Wells Fargo Secured Credit Card.  The annual fee is very low which is something I need as I am still climbing out of a financial hole and that is the only fee I have to worry about paying.  The interest rate when you buy something is high but it is to be expected when you get a card and have bad credit.

I did not have previous experience with them, but knew Wells Fargo to be a huge institution and figured we would be hard-pressed to ever speak with a human being again. I couldn't have been more wrong. When I encountered issues setting up our account online, I called the technical support number and within five minutes had a friendly representative walk me through the process.  When our mortgage payment suddenly jumped up, I called to find out why. Being a new home owner, I appreciated the information readily available from Wells Fargo and that they never once treated me in anything but a respectful manner when I asked what I am sure were some very stupid questions.

I was given several different phone numbers of people to contact in regards to prequalification. I tried calling each number at least four times, leaving messages and information on each call. I was never called back. This really does not make me want to do business with them any longer if they cannot even return a simple phone call, and this was with the three people I left messages for.

Their standard policy in a case like this was to wait and give a provisional credit in a few days, but after explaining my dire need for immediate funds to one of the reps they made an exception and gave me an instant credit, allowing me to purchase my necessary goods for school the next day.

Even logging into the account online is problematic because they constantly try to get you to sign up for different services like automatic bill pay. This causes an unwanted delay in getting to my information. Speaking of information, one of the emails you can't turn off is a monthly summary of account activity in PDF format, which is completely useless because it's actually easier to check account activity - whenever you want and not just once a month - by going to the website and logging in. But what gets me the most, after all that, is how right in the middle of my service, they went and stopped making the account free. No sir, now there's a $10 charge for holding the account, because there isn't enough money in it. (A classic, right? Pay us money if and only if you can't. If you can, we'll give you money instead.)

I called to dispute it because I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t aware of the ATM fees, and they refunded half the money so it went down to the domestic non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawal fees ($2.50 per withdrawal).

I noticed at the end of one month that over 10 fees of $2 had been assessed. I immediately contacted the bank, at which time they explained there is a limit on transfers and that I was therefore assessed a penalty for each transfer beyond the limit.

I asked if this could change in the future, and the gentlemen who was servicing me insisted it wouldn't.  Figuring his answer was good enough, I admittedly neglected to go over every detail of the fine print that was handed to me.  Several months later, I was surprised to receive a charge for merely having an account with the bank.  The charge wasn't astronomical, but I was annoyed considering the information I was given.  I returned to the bank to question the charge, and was told that the paperwork I was given stated that charges could basically be assigned at random.

As long as you only use it for the basic needs of a checking account, it can be pretty much totally free, which is a huge perk. Customer service in all of the locations I've been to has always been great and fairly quick. One of my complaints would be that if you DO need any other services (cashier's check, money wire transfer, using your card or withdrawing money in a foreign country, etc.) the fees associated with them are often extremely high in comparison with some other banks I've had experience with in the past. That being said, I use these services so rarely and because Wells Fargo locations are so plentiful and convenient, I continue to use them. On the plus side, we've received phone warnings of fishy transactions using our account, they've never lost or messed up a deposit (which has happened to me with other banks and was a nightmare!), and the new ATM's make deposits totally a breeze (they just scan your check or cash in and print off a picture even on your receipt)."},{"date":"2012-06-04","name":"Leah Smith","user_id":"couturecuts","verified":false,"product":"Wells Fargo Checking","review_comment":false,"stars":4,"review":"My husband and I have been with Wells Fargo now for just over 2 years.

That makes it a little difficult seeing as we designate one of those accounts for all gas money, then as we need it we transfer it into the checking account to spend at the gas pump. So we do wish there was no limit on how many times we could transfer or withdraw money each month.

They offer automatic payment which is another complete bonus because now we do not have to waste a stamp every month as our payment is deducted automatically.

The main reason why I love this bank, especially my branch in Huntsville, AL is because they make everything simple and easy to understand. Plus, my branch isn't a huge building wise as other competing banks are. It's small with fewer employees which in my opinion makes for the best customer service. The tellers know you by name at a small location and ask about the family. I have business account with another bank and though I like the other bank, I'm tied between it and Wells Fargo. I love the simplicity that the employees bring to the atmosphere of a small branch like mine. The customer service over the phone is wonderful as well with representatives that are superb in doing their job efficiently and effectively. I would recommend this bank to anyone wanting a smaller, more well known business that can still be trusted by many with their financial problems.

Online transfers, ACH payments, and other payments go through in a day or two at the most compared to a lot of banks where its 5-7 business days. They have decent interest rates and their fees are reasonable compared to other banks. Another thing I like about Wells Fargo is they have good, long hours so you can stop in mostly any time. The number one thing what I think separates Wells Fargo from other banks is the knowledgeable, friendly staff that is always willing to help you!

But today those bumps seem to have smoothed out and I am happy that I am with Wells Fargo, a company which consistently makes the \"best of\" list in the financial services industry and is growing and expanding the number of its branches at a record rate. I do both my personal and business banking with Wells Fargo and they have been quick to spot fraud the few times my account number has been used inappropriately, and equally quick to warn me and credit me back the money. They were very helpful in getting my non-profit checking and savings business accounts set up, and no matter which branch I go to (and there are branches everywhere in Houston so I am always in luck when I need to bank!) they are super friendly and nice.

The one thing that I must say is that even if I didn't agree with what they were doing, they have always been nice to me. Wells Fargo facilities are always accommodating with nice furniture. The most trouble that I have had with them is that they were not up front about certain fees, and even signed me up for a type of savings account that I didn't want!

I don\u2019t have much experience with customer service at Wells Fargo since I mainly use their ATM's.  I like the envelope-free deposit option on their ATM's.

Their overdraft policy was just re-worked to eliminate some of the more confusing fees should that be an issue, though it does seem like the odd fee pops up from time to time.  Also, a five dollar fee every time I withdraw from a non-Wells Fargo ATM is quite annoying.  However, customer service, both in-branch and on the phone, has always been top notch.

Any time I have ever had the slightest problem with my account, no matter how small, they are always more than willing to help. The only thing that is not very satisfying with wells fargo is the interest rates. I currently have a checking and saving account with them, and the checking account accrues no interest while the savings only .25% APY. Even though I am pleased with them overall, I have also been notified that they are about to start charging for having a debit card through them, which I don't think is a very good idea or deal, since many other banks offer that service completely free of charge.

I like the fact that if you don't have enough money in the bank to make a payment on a bill, with the bank's discretion they could do an overdraft for you and charge you an overdraft fee.

Although their checking and savings account fees can be a little on the high side, I still find them very reasonable. The most important service WF provides is excellent customer service. No matter what town I'm in (and I have visited WF branches in several different states, and most of California), the staff is always so helpful and friendly. In an effort to be prepared when I get to the teller window, I usually head over to the supply counter first so I can fill out my own slips. However, the staff never lets me get too far before calling me over and offering to fill everything out for me. So refreshing! And almost every employee (even if they have a customer sitting in front of them) will look up whenever a customer walks into the branch, smile, and say \"hi\". I have had many pleasant dealings with the telephone bankers as well. I have had several issues where I was charged a fee on an account that I was not expecting. They always reverse it without question, and make sure I am well informed as to how to avoid further fees. They also do not charge an annual fee for IRA's (which most banks do). I have tried out several other banks and always end up closing my account and bringing the business back to WF.

I have refinanced twice, and in both cases I found the process to be very simple, fast and easy to complete. We didn't even have to go into an office to close on the new loan - the first time they sent a person to the house while we signed the documents, and the second time we received everything via courier, signed it and returned it the same way. We made a few mistakes in the signing but they were super-fast to help us resolve them at no cost or delay.

Of course, that was untrue, which they should have known because I was a student with barely enough to get by. To pay itself off, I would need to spend thousands of dollars on my check card each year. Other than this deception, which I'm guessing is something they try to sell to everyone, the customer service has always been good at Wells Fargo. I have never had any problems with my account, and the bank has always been more than willing to answer my doubts and questions. As I have never banked with anyone else, I can't accurately say where they stand in comparison with others. Overall, they have been a good, stable bank for me and my family, supporting all our banking needs with good service and quick replies. They have also been pretty flexible for our individual needs.

They have always been professional and friendly and I have always gotten good customer service.  What I do not like is the obvious influnce of a large national corporation and their policies.  Just a couple weeks ago I went and asked to speak with a representative because I wanted to avoid some fees that would be applied to my account because of some changes that were obviously directed by somebody far above.  And while the person was friendly enough and did a very good job at helping me with what I needed, she also tried to sell me a bunch of stuff.  While good products are good products, it did feel very much like she was trying to sell me stuff just to sell me stuff, rather than because it was in my best interest.  The certificates of achievement issued by some higher ups in the company for her selling accomplishments backed up these suspicions.
