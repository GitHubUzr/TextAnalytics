Checking,They try to charge me $5 to replace my debit card that’s not working and my card keeps getting declined everywhere when I have the funds available in my account.
Credit Cards,"This was the first credit card that I have ever received. It was a pleasant surprise to actually be approved for the card in the first place seeing that I was a new college student with no prior credit, and to make matters worse it was shortly after the economic collapse and no one was really giving out credit.After receiving the card it was everything that I could have asked for. I was started on a basic 500$ limit, which was all that I was really looking for. I also did have a points based reward program which turned out to be very beneficial. Every experience with Bank of America has been positive, and there is really nothing negative that I could say."
Credit Cards,"I used the Walmart Credit Card for 2-3 years without any issues. Unfortunately, my first large purchase (over $1k) was made with a service provider that did not deliver on its promises. I disputed the charge with Synchrony Bank and after 3-4 months of going back and forth with an assigned case worker, she stopped responding to my calls. Now, I sit on hold for over 25-30 minutes with their main telephone line before becoming frustrated and giving up. Synchrony Bank does not protect its customers. I will be paying my final bill, closing the account and taking my business elsewhere. Don't waste your time and open a line of credit with another business!"
Credit Cards,"I’ve been using the Bank Americard for a little over two years and have mostly positive things to say about it.  The customer service has been great, as I have needed to call in a few times with regards to increasing my credit limit and to report a lost card.  Each time the representative was helpful, pleasant and quite efficient.  My credit limit started at $800, but was increased to $1000 with a simple call and only a few questions regarding my employment status.  It is a rather “bare bones” card in the sense that you don’t get any rewards, but it is very simple to use.  It connects with your Bank of America online checking account which makes it very easy to pay monthly bills as well.  All in all, I would recommend the card for young adults or students looking for their first basic credit card, as was the case with myself."
Credit Cards,"Use for all amazon purchase and when I need it on any other purchase, My go to card. Nice to get the 5% on prime purchase and less% on other purchase. Not sure what the Interest rate is I always pay in full."
Credit Cards,"I can't really say enough good things about this credit card.  As long as you use it responsibly you can really add up the money you earn very quickly.  There are 5% cash back categories rotating every 3 months but half the time those categories are gas, which is great especially if you drive around a lot like I do.  Also the other half of the time you get great categories like Amazon.com or restaurants, so if you eat out a lot or shop online this is a great card as well!  The only limitation is that the 5% bonus only stacks up for the first $1500 spent per 3 month period.  However, don't forget you get 1% cash back everywhere else which is unlimited!  This is not like other points where the value of a point isn't equivalent to 1 cent.  You can straight cash out points for CASH!  100 points is 1 dollar.  No catches, no gimmicks, straight cash.  Also if you're a Chase checking customer you get a bonus 10 points for every purchase (big or small!)  So if you get a small coffee for 70 cents you just earned OVER %10 cashback (around %15 to be exact).  In fact on any purchase under 5 dollars you will always earn at least 3% cash back as a Chase checking customer.  Also as a signup bonus you can get anywhere from $100-200 dollars just look for good offers online.  I would highly recommend this card to anyone as long as you are responsible!"
Credit Cards,"I have been using Chase as my only bank or years now, and it is just a delight. The customer service is prompt and knowledgeable, and their card is one of the best I have ever seen around. They do send quite a lot of mail if you don't select the paperless option, but the card is still great. It links to my primary bank account which is also helpful; and the card itself is very flexible to my needs. I try to use it mostly as a debit card and Chase seems to have been able to get that done on their own."
Credit Cards,"I like this card because it doesn't come with a load of hidden interest rates. I keep the balance on my card low so I don't have a ton of interest to pay off. I find that whenever I have to call customer service, the representative is always helpful. One of the only things i dislike about the card are it's high late fees."
Credit Cards,Worst card ever.  I first got the card in 2010.  The number was stolen before I ever even took my card off the mailer.  Turned out it was an inside job and someone had charge a computer to my card.   I should have gotten rid of it then and didn't. Finally got that worked out. Yesterday when I tried to use the card it was denied.  I called customer service and they told me I had an $11.31 balance that was due Aug 27.  I told them that I had the card for years never missed or was late but I did not receive a statement.  The $11.31 was not even 5 business days late and they denied my sale.  I received a statement today and another 13.31 was added onto the $11.31.  It is really funny how I got statements since 2010 with no problem and have never once been late but for this measly balance they denied my sale not even being 5 days late.  They could keep their card.  I will never deal with Citibank or for that matter Sears again.
Credit Cards,"Just. Say. No. They held my statement hostage for inactivity and refused to rekey it to me. 2 hours trying to get my current statement and they sent me the wrong one. How unethical can’t you get!?!? Charge on the card, every month or you can’t pay it. File a complaint with the FTC. If they aren’t playing fair. I’m getting a consolidated loan at 11% and firing this company."
Credit Cards,"Card is great. Problem is, we don’t understand the points system for rewards, and I believe we miss out on a great deal. Plan is too complicated for many of us."
Credit Cards,"I initially got this Wells Fargo secured business credit card when I started my nanny business. I made the decision to go with Wells Fargo security card because I had a bank account with Wells Fargo. Previously, I had been married and had to file bankruptcy when I divorced . I faced many troubles when I was starting my small business. I will be grateful to Wells Fargo and the secured business card because I was able to build my credit up from virtually nothing.My credit score went up and I was able to pursue other ventures, but this was my start. My initial investment was $5000. I would recommend this to anybody who is looking to start a small business and may have some past financial mistakes."
Checking,"Debit card was not automatically sent out when the old one expired. I have been waiting a week to get the new one in. When you try calling customer service, the replay is to ""Please call back again"" and then the call is disconnected. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE"
Credit Cards,"Definitely the WORST customer service and WORST online banking platform!! Nothing works correctly, and then you can't get help with their foreign call-center customer service who can only walk you through the steps they've been given. If anything isn't functioning correctly it's not in their procedure steps, and they always just tell me to ""wait 24 hours"" and try again. It took a month just to reset my password, no joke! I had to fight to get the number of a representative in the U.S. and it still took several days for that person to call me back.Just for a few more examples, when I tried to pay the card online, a message came up saying I must have a connected phone number. My (mobile) phone number was already on the account when I set it up, I went into my info to add it and it was already there! Same thing with making transfers. Then I tried again to make a transfer and it would only accept savings or checking to balance transfer, not credit. Then my bank accounts kept disappearing from the list of connected accounts. Haven't been able to redeem rewards yet either. Auto payments don't go through. This is all in my first 3 months no less!It would be a great card if it wasn\'t such a nightmare to deal with the company and online banking!! I literally started to believe this was a fake/fraud company when I first got this card (we'll see how the future goes I guess!) The offers and rewards sound great. But it seems that the company couldn't care less. I DO NOT recommend this card right now!"
Credit Cards,Closed this BoA credit card after the bank released info on citizens without a warrant. Shameful act on management's part violating privacy rights.
Credit Cards,"The Capital One Venture Rewards credit card is great because the annual fee is $0 for the first year. I do not like that it jumps up to $59 on the second year, though. I think the bonus program is exceptional for travelers, because spending $2,000 gets you 20,000 bonus miles, which is fantastic. The downside, of course, is that you have to rack up $2,000 within the first 3 months to get it. But there are no limits on the miles you can receive after that, so it all works out. Overall, the card's value is excellent."
Credit Cards,"Great, tool to monitor and track spending and budgets.  Nothing like knowing where you stand in your credit status. I have referred this site to my friends."
Credit Cards,I recently got a credit line increase of 15 thousand and today they called me and a very rude lady told me they are shutting the card down no reason giving ! I kept asking and they simply said they are closing it !
Credit Cards,I will pay this account off then close it. I will get to the point where I will only have 1 major credit card for emergency purchases only!
Checking,I would not recommend using this bank.  They closed my account without notifying me and when I called them for my money that was in the account they said they turned it over to the state of California unclaimed property.  There is no record of them sending the money to them.  DO NOT BANK HERE!!!!!
Mortgages,"Once again Wells Fargo shows their true colors as a heartless almost criminal Bully of the Banking World. Throughout 2020 during the Covid 19 pandemic Wells Fargo offered a payment relief program to be able to skip payments and add them on to the end of the mortgage. I found that shockingly surprising given their normal ruthless banking practices. We took advantage of the program and today we received a demand letter for the entire amount in full, threatening eviction. This company should be fined for their unfair, intimidating, and offensive business practices. "
Credit Cards,"I first received this card when I opened a student account with my bank in my first year of college. I wanted a simple and good card to charge my textbooks on. I easily obtained this card. It received an excellent limit for someone first starting out with credit and who's learning how to be responsible. It even comes without fees. A great perk about this card is it's a part of a rewards program that gives you the opportunity to earn points while using the card. For every $2 you spend, you receive 1 point back. When you receive enough points, you can even receive cash back if you wish."
Credit Cards,"I have had this card for between 3 and 4 years now. I have enjoyed having the card. I found myself not using it except in cases of emergency because the interest rate is, in my opinion, very high. I like that they allow for online payments as well as online account management. It makes things much easier. I have had to call customer service a few times with some questions and was very satisfied with the customer service and support I received. they were very friendly and helpful. This card is a good card to have and you should consider this one if you are looking to get a credit card."
Checking,"Compared to other banks they are crooks. I've banked with them for 20 years and stayed with them out of loyalty. I decided to open bank accounts with other banks and it made me realize what a horrible bank PNC is as far as fees, charges, customer service, available branches - everything."
Credit Cards,I have a credit card rating of 830 plus.I always pay my cards in full each month. CITI website is full of inconsistencies with misleading statements. I aplied for an autopay more than 2 weeks in advance to pay for a a bill that was due. The autopay ignored it thereby charging me a $40  interest on the due date. It again charged me an interest of $37 after the next billing cycle even when the autopay has kicked in and paid in full. The account manager said that it takes more than a month for the autopay to set in. Unsusual!!! Other credit card companies require a miimum of 2 weeks for the autopay to set in. THOU SHALL NOT USE THIS CARD.
Credit Cards,"Its a decent card. Wells fargo has called me wondering what I was spending on which made me feel like I was protected. I had bought a laptop and my card was frozen because of how big the purchase was.the interest rate is pretty high but that's to be expected, its a credit card. rewards are nice but really not enough. The payments became higher than I was expecting, and being a college kid, that really takes a toll on my monthly income. Kinda regret getting this card but it has helped in some tough situations. Do your research before you apply."
Credit Cards,"The Harley-Davidson Secured Credit Card is an excellent card to have when you are trying to repair your credit. It offers no annual fee or no monthly fee to have this credit card, this is huge to me because I hate paying any unneeded monthly fees. Especially when you are trying to fix your credit and you need all the help you can get. You do have to make a deposit and the deposit is also your credit spending limit. This is a good thing, because you will never overspend and run up debt you cannot afford, you are trying to fix your credit after all. Harley-Davidson Secured Credit Card gives you protection against fraud, so if it is stolen, no sweat and is a nice feature to have. With good management and control of this credit card they will eventually offer you a unsecured card that gives you a credit line without depositing money. Do not be discouraged by the Harley-Davidson logo, this is one of the best cards on the market to help you repair your credit and I highly recommend it."
Credit Cards,I have enjoyed having this card for the past 3 years with Bank of America.  I have experienced great customer service and have taken advantage of the 0% intro APR.  I was able to transfer a balance from another card and have it paid off due to my Bank of America card being interest free.  I have also have taken advantage of being able to connect my other Bank of America accounts so I can use overdraft protection.  I have not had any problems with my account and Bank of America wired me money from my credit card internationally when my card was lost.
Credit Cards,"I opened a Kohl's account to further boost my credit score. After a short time having the card some fraud charges had been made. I asked about my options for these charges and they closed the account wiped the charges and hit my credit score -50 points. I called multiple times to fix this, even pay the charges and was told they won't reopen a card. I didn't want this closed but ultimately the customer service ran me around. Not a card a would advise anyone to get."
Credit Cards,"Poor business practice!!!! First off, I paid my credit card in FULL, including additional credit to take care of the interest that normally accrues during the cycle date. A week later I received a refund check, which I assumed was after they took out the accrued interest. NOPE! A month later I get a bill for $19, so I gave them a call only to be told there’s nothing they can do because it’s money I owe. Even though I left a credit on my account for that reason it’s still my responsibility. Ok, I’ll do your job and mine! Way to take care of a long time curstomer!"
