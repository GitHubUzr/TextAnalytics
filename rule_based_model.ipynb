It has been over 2 months and PNC STILL has yet to successfully complete the transfer - however they have absolutely no problem showing that I owe them this non-existent balance, as well as making me pay on it (they denied two pleading requests to please freeze my account/do not charge until the balance transfers are finally done which I think is reasonable at it has been over two months). Neither capital one nor chase have received this balance transfer amount from PNC as they were supposed to 8+ weeks ago, and now it is showing I have double credit amount out on 3 cards instead of my previous limit on 2 cards. The first PNC representative I called was avoiding questions and telling me misinformation. The second PNC representative seemed better but still the information I was told seemed extremely inconclusive. I am beyond disappointed with PNC and this experience. I have been a PNC bank/checking customer for over 10 years, always recommended them for banking, and therefore totally trusted them in this credit card process.

When calling customer service,  they \"require\" that you give them All your information, as if you are opening a new account. Apparently BBVA does not have the ability to pull up your account unless you give them ALL of your personal information. None of my other credit card companies ask for that much personal info. Some info to verify, I can understand, name, last four of SSN, address, last four of account number....However, if a CS rep is asking for info such as to fill out a new CC application. \"What is your yearly income?\" \"Do you own or rent?\" ..ect. That is to much info to give out over the phone just to access your account. Use your own judgment and caution if you are thinking about BBVA as a \"reliable credit card company\". My experience with BBVA was bad. Definitely would NOT recommend BBVA. As of today, I have cancelled all accounts with BBVA. DO NOT use BBVA Bank, and/or BBVA Credit Cards. THEY ARE A SCAM!

Money? Users?

All other credit card companies offer free copies of statements from almost any time period. The poor reviews I've read here are accurate. While they do offer credit cards at competitive rates, the customer service agents are rude, vague, uncaring and incompetent; they offer inaccurate information which changes from agent to agent. I've also been told a \"manager\" would call me back to resolve my issue at least 5 times, as the manager is in a \"meeting\" and can't speak with me at the moment. I have not once received a phone call from any \"manager.\" In addition, there seems to be no complaints department, as I was once transferred there, only to find myself at a strange computerized menu which was meaningless.
