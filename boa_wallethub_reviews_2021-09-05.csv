2021-09-04,tomalbert848,tomalbert848,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"I had some nagging late payments, medical bills, student loans and bankruptcy filed 2018. I had credit score of 522(TransUnion), 555(Experian) and 573(Equifax) as of 27th of April 2020. I applied for a surgery loan in July but was not approved because of my poor credit profile. I contacted my loan officer, he explained that I needed a score of 740+ and the bankruptcy removed from my credit report before I can be qualified for the loan. I had to seek for a way to raise my score and bring my credit profile up to speed because I had to do the surgery at that time. I made some research and got some good reviews and strong recommendations on ROOTKITS CREDIT SPECIALIST who has helped a lot of people in the state. So I decided to email him via: rootkitscreditspecialist @ gmail . com He replied and asked me to text him at    760   474   3440 for further discussion. I did and he explained the process to me in every simple term. We got started with the process after 9 days, he removed the bankruptcy, deleted other negative items and also raised my score to 805 excellent. I’m super excited."

2021-09-04,totoalbert867,totoalbert867,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"I just feel like crying. I was back and forth with a property manager for an apartment I won’t get. She stated my rental filing is not an eviction but was showing on tenant safe site software. There were two programs preventing me from renting; national tenant network and tenant safe. I couldn’t move I was on the both of this site with a tenant filing. My name is Toto Albert my score was 544 I can’t get anything due to being immature few years back. I have few negative items; I have default with telecom companies and also credit card debts. I went online and found PINNACLE CREDIT SPECIALIST who save my life. I emailed him via: pinnaclecreditspecialist@gmail.com and texted him on +1 810 666 0777. We had a conversation on how he was going to fix my credit for me to be qualified for everything. He actually promised to help me bring my credit profile back to life. After 11 days he deleted every negative item on my credit report, he removed the negative tenant filing from national tenant network and tenant safe site. He also raised my credit score 802 standard score. I’m now qualified to rent an apartment and move in with my wife and kids. I strongly recommend him for credit repair, Chex system and DUI fix."

I was severally denied of loan because I had an Eviction and criminal judgment on my credit report that has been on my report for about 3 years and I was turned down several times trying to get a new  apartment for my family; 760PLUS CREDIT SCORE was recommended to me by Grand ma, and they got me results in 12 days from mailing, I had to update my ID to my new address and I did my part very fast, from the time I made my upfront payment, I had 2 bureaus Finished under 10 days!  I was scammed by some companies for 10 months and they cleaned NOTHING!

When I was buying my house they were not my mortgage but they were very helpful and advised me what to do and how to do it and I got my house I would not change banks I’m in it for the long-haul"
2021-08-31,Richard,moredock,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,4,The card has had a relatively low interest rate. When Other cards had > 10% I was paying 10% or less on this card. Have had the card for years.

2021-08-29,sonjapenner,sonjapenner,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,"They started out great but I recently have been let down over and over. Impossible to get through to the right customer service person. Dropped calls. Plus, the final straw...I talked with someone (finally) about setting up auto pay each month so my balance would be paid automatically and I didn't have to schedule it manually each month. They said to pay the next balance like usual because it would take a payment cycle to kick in. I did this. The bill was about $5,000. Then I discover they also took the $5k out of my account leaving me with a zero balance suddenly and fees from my credit union. I called (2 hours on the phone) to get to someone who said they would refund it in 2 business days. 7 days later, no refund. I call again (another 2 hours I will never get back) and they say usually 2-5 but since it's a large amount, it might take 10 days or more, because it needs special approval. WHAT? This is your mistake and my money. I ask about them refunding the fees I was charged because of their mistake. ""Sorry, we can't possibly do that. Ask your credit union to refund you"" Why should my little CU pay for their mistakes. This is criminal to take double dip and then keep my money. Don't get it! In the process for looking for another card now."
2021-08-28,kelvinh_12,kelvinh_12,False,Bank of America Business Services,1,"Bank of America is the worst bank to bank with, I made a purchase for 60 and then 2 days later I had to overdraw my account for 200. How the same night I owe 2 overdraft fee when I knew of only 1 for the 200, I had the 60 on the account and it was already taken to the merchant before I took out the 200, so why Bank of America robbing me, I will never bank with them again Pnc is way better anyways, Bank of America don’t care about their business relationship with customer at all. I’m trying to bring my account back to positive but they don’t want to take off the 2nd overdraft. And had me on the phone over an hour to change nothing and the first rep hung up. This is all being recording. I’m taking my business to another bank. Simple"
2021-08-27,fayesimp5,fayesimp5,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"They were a good credit card for building credit, had to close because of medical reason. Their interest rate was too high ,but helped in time of need."
2021-08-25,whuser67543642,whuser67543642,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,"This card gives me the lowest credit line, and they use the lowest credit reporting agency and their bank require a $100 amount in your checking account at all times along with a $4.95 monthly fee even though I have direct deposit. Therefore, I pay credit bills through them and I save no money with them."
2021-08-24,mariah urban,mariah_urban,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,DO NOT USE BOA worst bank ever takes hours to talk to someone on the phone their automatic payment service does not work and the customer reps are clueless they will charge you returned payment fees even though it is their fault
2021-08-23,PETER,porleetan,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,4,The reason that I got bank of America card is because it gives you cash back on your purchases and 3 points on gas fill up also I use to pay for my other credit card.

2021-08-21,Jr Gonzalez,Jaygonzalez,False,Bank of America Checking,1,I GOT CHARGED 35 DOLLARS FOR OVERDRAFT FEE. WHICH IS I NEVER HAD A NEGATIVE ACCOUNT. I ALWAYS HAVE A MONEY ON IT. BECAUSE I HATE GETTING CHARGES FOR SOMETHING NOT FAIR. THEY SAID IT DIDN'T POST EARLY THE ELECTONIC PAYMENT I DID BUT IT WASN'T MY FAULT. EVEN THOUGH I STILL HAVE MONEY LEFT. HAD AN ARGUMENT WITH THEM. AT THE END THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE MY REFUND. I'M GOING TO CLOSE MY BANK. I HATE THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE.
2021-08-18,dmc670,dmc670,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,"Say NO to Balance Transfers!!! Listen and ATTENTION my fellow consumers...NEVER use BOA for balance transfers. I have used other companies for promotions/balance transfers such as Best Buy, Barclay, Discover, etc and they ALL will send me emails multiple times to remind me when the balance transfer or promotion is expiring and when to make that payment to AVOID any interest. Not this company, not a single email or reminder. After all isn't that why we are using Balance transfers?? I recently paid off my balance transfer with BOA and I get a bill for $10.07 because my payment what they described was late(not posted by the end date on the transfer but on time for my statement due date(early in fact). I called and asked for a courtesy waive of the fee. They said it was legit because my payment didn't post by the date even though it was within the cycle. (meaning it was paid by the date on the bill). They are RIDICULOUS!!! What a way to treat a customer that made every payment on time. Hey, BOA it's not the money, it is the principle!!!! I will NEVER use them again, the card has been cut.. Bye Bye!!"
2021-08-18,Rick,poolrick,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,Bank of America is the best. 3% back on purchases (goes directly into my savings account). Regular credit increases have helped me survive and to build better credit. I started with a secured card and a year later they returned my deposit and tripled my limit. My limit has increased every two years along with my rising FICO score. BOA has been honest and fair and always available to answer questions. Thanks BOA.
2021-08-17,hnibbelin,hnibbelin,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,2,"I hold this card just for emergencies, quite frankly.  I was charged a late fee after I had told them I did not receive the ebill and they did not waive it, considering it was the first occurrence since I had opened it, had never been late on payment nor had a history of late payments.  It was disappointing but I guess that is B of A's way of business.  I also do not bank with B of A as a typical matter.  I use Citibank and they are the best bank ever!  Maybe one day they will switch to Citibank."
2021-08-17,caridad,devegascaridad1960,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,This is  GREAT credit card for me. Minimum payment is thirty-five dollars and I pay one hundred dollars per month way before due date.  I love this card and I am grateful for having it
2021-08-17,ridgelandllc360,ridgelandllc360,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,"One star too many! Have had two business accounts with B of A for years. I made an honest mistake applying payment to wrong account and other became past due. Adam the ""representative"" could see I made a mistake, but had NO authority to make the adjustments, forcing me to pay the late fee and finance charge. We're done - closing 2 business accounts and 1 personal account. More callous than any bank I've dealt with in my +30 year business career; and I have done business or had accounts with at least 15 to 25 over that time."
2021-08-16,Heather,fiveletterslady,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,2,"The card has a $39 per year fee. I’ve had it almost 7 years still a low limit - $2000. My other cards have MUCH higher limits. I have great credit.  I keep it to use for internet purchases, it’s easily monitored and keeps my other higher limit cards safe from the web."
2021-08-15,Jimmy,jimmysullins5521,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,Key bank helps so much in rebuilding credit its a secured card by making easy monthly payments on time makes it easy and simple to build better credit
2021-08-15,Meg,megifl,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,3,Bank of America is okay. Their fees are high. However they're convenient. Although I would not open my business account there they are easy for travel accounts
2021-08-15,Juanita,juanitabsumpter,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"So far, so good. It's a great card to include in my arsenal. I'll definitely take advantage of the low interest rate as well as looking forward to raising the credit limit on this card. This would be enough to push my credit score to a perfect 850!"
2021-08-14,sana790,sana790,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,I make payments on time I missed one payment and BoA did not waive my late fees. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Very rude reps don’t even want to listen to you. I have been a loyal customer for years and I forgot to make a payment by 2 days and it was my first time getting late fee they did not even consider to waive it off!!!
2021-08-13,martawagner,martawagner,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,I AM STOPPING DOING BUSINESS WITH BANK OF AMERICA AFTER 21 YEARS THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AT THE 800 # IS TERRIBLE HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND HARD TO HEAR WHAT IT IS THEY ARE ASKING   WENT    TO THE BRANCH  ONLY 1 ASSOCIATE HELPING CUSTOMERS WAITED 45MINUTES AND COULD NOT HELP ME EITHER  ENOUGH IS ENOUGH  ADIOS!!!!!
2021-08-13,donnie,donniew_9,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,3,The $100 a year is not worth the card. There are cards that give you the same cash back and do not charge $100 a year. So I would recommend Discover Cards are other Visa cards Mastercards.

2021-08-12,kathycarlton,kathycarlton,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,I use this card just for all my travel.  I use the points as on board credit when I do cruise  I feel that I get rewarded for having a good time on vacation.  Redeeming the points is not difficult  I do it on the phone
2021-08-12,hpm_mcclendon,hpm_mcclendon,False,Bank of America Checking,3,"Way better bank than First Security bank. They have that going for them. I have done business with them off and on through the years and would say they are middle of the road or slightly better. There are fees, but they are reasonable."
2021-08-11,mgerlich,mgerlich,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"I've been a BOA customer for decades. My husband and I have substantial funds in multiple accounts with this institution. Recently, my checking account fell below the required $1,500 minimum -- to $1485 --for three days, and they assessed a $12 account management fee as a fine. I called to request a one-time courtesy removal of that fee, given the substantial funds we have at BOA and my long history as an A+ customer.  I was declined by both the agent and her supervisor, who said they had made no error in assessing the fee so I didn't merit a refund.  I KNOW it's just $12. But there is a bigger point here: How do you treat your long-term customers?  Evidently, with disdain. They said there is ""only black and white"" in assessing these requests. What sharks. This is what gives banks a bad name: Squeezing the customer for every dime they can assess. This issue could have been handled graciously and I could have walked away a happy customer. Instead, I'm looking for another bank."
2021-08-08,Richard,richardl_333,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,The bank does not recognize posting mistakes & instead marks accounts delinquent - Missed payments I've not ever missed a payment.
2021-08-08,sharon_16,sharon_16,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,I’ve never had any issues using credits for travel with BOA until they did a system change about a year ago. The new search engine is HORRIBLE. It will not allow you to book using mixed seat classes anymore forcing me to book individual one way segments. Not only does it end up costing more points but an absolute nightmare getting the airline to recognize that you’re actually traveling through the segments. They used to use the Orbitz search engine which gave so many options. Not anymore. Worst upgrade ever!
2021-08-07,Faith Zoy,Gandom,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"Never recommend it to anybody! I closed my bank with them but I had some refunds coming through. It has been since May 2021 that I am waiting on my refund to be sent through a check but it has not happened. I have been calling them but they just bouncing me around. Goodness, what a nightmare with this bank. I would give them zero stars if I could."
2021-08-07,Adam,adamf_17,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"I am going to use this credit card to travel by train as soon as it is possible to do so. Unfortunately, there are a lot of selfish people who refuse to wear masks or get vaccinated. Those people need to be eliminated from the earth."

2021-08-06,sco86z,sco86z,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"The 2 local branches have no drive thru tellers. One of them just randomly closes the branch on Friday's. They place a 5 day hold on a workers compensation check which is from a Boa account. They state  there's specific information on the check indicating it might be returned. When you call and ask why there's a hold on a check that's issued from a Boa account they say there isn't a hold but yet you have a receipt stating the hold and it shows the hold in your account. I said I can walk in and cash the check so how can I do that if there's specific information on the check indicating it may be returned, as usual no answer from the incompetent employees.  They put a hold on certified bank checks stating there's specific information indicating it may be returned. A certified bank can't be returned which is why it's called a certified bank check. They deny atm transactions but yet negative your account for each transaction and then add it back."
2021-08-06,Rosetta Johnson,rosettaj718,False,Bank of America Checking,1,Bank of America employees are liars and they enable criminals. I guarantee you that this is the next bank that will close. Because they are very unfair to their customers. They let someone steal my car note and car insurance. And now lying about it. I’m taking this to the courts.

2021-08-04,James,mcmullan_jim,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,High introductory limit to start. Easy to use. Strong web site. Easy to switch categories for increased rewards if spending changes.
2021-08-04,Daniel,drbourque86,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,4,I love my B.O.A. cash rewards credit card. I would have given a full 5-star review however I have had the card for almost two years and they have not given me a credit limit increase. I have asked and twice got a hard inquiry and was denied. And also their fico score reporting is always very late to update. It's always two months behind all the updates from other reporting agencies.
2021-08-03,jerry_960,jerry_960,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"My story starts with going to my local branch looking to set up a trust account. The lady on staff did not know how but was willing to try. She did not know answers to basic questions and had to look them up. This made me feel uneasy. Anyone that knows a trust must be setup properly or it is invalid or you could have serious issues later. Their trust account person was out so I made an appointment. I did receive a call that their trust person would not be available until Friday. I made another appointment for the following Tuesday. Upon arriving I was told now it would be two more weeks and would have to be represented by the same lady that knows nothing. I was upset and asked to speak with the manager. When I spoke with the assistant manager I was stern and direct but not rude or profound. The assistant manager got angry with me so I tried to be more respectful and was apologizing with ""I am Sorry Sir for being upset"". His comment was calling him Sir was not going to make any difference. After a while he calmed down and referred me to another branch 30 min away. My point is I made 3 attempts to open this account. Any client or protentional client should have been called about the qualified agent not being available. I was treated rudely by the representing manager and now glad that I did not use their services. Good news I did find a local Trust Bank with a friendly knowledgeable staff that was great! I would stay away from Bank Of America. They are just too big to care!!!!!!"
2021-08-03,Serhii,serggrey,False,Bank of America Checking,1,Worst bank ever. They messed with everything they could - starting from opening wrong account type and up to - how they manage fraudulent transactions. Avoid them and save your money.

2021-07-29,syismaster1,syismaster1,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"This was my first credit card. Started off with $500 secured and they automatically raised it to $700 after 5 months. I had the card manually graduated to $1200 CL after 6 months of use with a quick phone call and it improved my credit by a-lot by having a lower utilization. I have to say, every branch I went to, multiple banking employees said ""We've never seen a secured card graduated earlier than 1-2 years"" or ""It takes 2 years I speak from experience."" I literally called 6 months after I got the card, graduated it to a normal credit card and helped my credit tremendously. The Bank Of America app is what makes this card outstanding. Being able to change the 3% cash back category before you make a big purchase is the best. No annual fee on this either, it is a good card to just have but I will be utilizing AMEX cards for the better rewards and have this as a back-up. This is a good card to build credit if you pay it off every month with no balance. Also the 2% on Wholesale clubs is awesome as I frequent Sams, Bj's and Costco a lot. The Foreign transaction fee is slightly annoying but not every card can be perfect I suppose. Again USE THE APP for this card. It literally transforms the experience of this card (being able to lock card in seconds) or order a replacement, check your FICO score for free. No complaints thanks Bank of America!I just wish they offered a credit card with good rewards such as AMEX."
2021-07-28,cozette60,cozette60,False,Bank of America Checking,3,Bank of America automated service when you call on the phone needs improvement.

2021-07-24,Texas Citizen,hotelljack,False,Bank of America Business Services,2,"I have personally been a BOA customer for scores of years and will remain so but  I encountered a BOA business policy recently that I think reflects a money grubbing attitude and shows BOA's lack of appreciation for their customers.  Specifically, BOA will not cash a Petty Cash check (specifically petty cash) written to a company by the multi-company owner on another bank, despite that lone company having just deposited thousands of dollars in their BOA account.  According to BOA, if your business owner, an owner of multiple businesses, writes a Petty Cash check from one company to another company it must be drawn on BOA for BOA to cash it.  If a business deposits $5,000 dollars in BOA and then asks BOA to cash a $100 Petty Cash check drawn on another bank with which the multi-business owner does business, It has been BOA's expressed policy that they will not cash that $100 petty cash check.  It seems to me that is BOA meddling in the operation of how an owner runs his business.In general, if a business owner has multiple business, worth millions of dollars, which are using bank #1, which is not BOA, but he has one business  in the same city for which it is more convenient to use BOA and that lone business deposits thousands in the BOA account, that lone business is still a 3rd class customer to BOA when it comes to cashing a Petty Cash check written to it by it's owner on another bank ."

Guess what - all the banks process autopay within 24 hours but Bank of America? Lazy and does not process until 2 billing cycles. and they do not even inform their customers about this and charge them late fees!!! wow - nice way of taking money from customers and paying BONUS to your employees or maybe eating out on customer's money !"

2021-07-19,Dean,burkalini,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,3,Brand new card. Got a good credit line. I will wait to see how long they take to pay my sign on bonus and readjust review then. I have heard both good and terrible on this card. Have had a chance to call service line and all the reviews are correct. It took three calls and 4 transfers before I talked to someone that knew how to help me. Not a good start. I will say they applied the cash bonus very quick but need to work on service
2021-07-18,Darnell,chitownismine,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,3,It’s an OK card not many thrills but has the potential to be an awesome rewards card if the company just changes its algorithm on its rewards strategy then it can be a winner
2021-07-15,Mack Akins,jonesstavo,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"Worst and slowest bank to have. There are so many other banks that offer the same services that are faster, free, and secure. Bank of America uses a multitude of convenient excuses while your money is tied up for 7 business days. It has taking me 5 business days to get my first Bank of America account to acknowledge that my second Bank of America account is not fraud.

No matter the issue that I have had with Bank of America, I have been given wrong information, misled, hung up on, and refused basic reference information. As a result, whenever I have called to follow up on anything, half of the call was trying to get connected to the right person and the other half has been being told that the information that I was acting on was simply wrong. Perhaps I am some outlier with especially bad luck, but I have not experienced this at any other bank that I've taken my business to. The only positive that I can say about Bank of America is that there are a lot of branches. Customer support is horrible and no bank (who I give my money) has ever treated me this way."

They have their own lingo which doesn't track with other major cards such as Chase/Citibank/Discover or even smaller cards such as American Airlines/JCPenney's/etc.  This makes it impossible to do things like log in/change AutoPay/make a one time payment or any of the minor interactions one might have.  And then there is their AutoPay system:  heaven forbid if you pay off your card and try to carry a 0 balance.  They will continue to take out your previous Auto payment and then later refund it to you - as you don't owe them anything!  And then, when you can't get a person at BOA to cancel the AutoPay (6 times), you tell your bank not to honor their automatic debit - they tag your Credit Score with reports of missed payments and so on.  No other credit card to my knowledge will continue to take out money when you have no balance.  There are many other cards that are much better than BOA"

We currently have a 30 year mortgage with them along with our investment portfolio and wanted to refinance to a 15 year with a lower interest rate. They said they would give us great rates and make it happen for less money and we stupidly bought into their BS! Here are the facts! Our home is easily valued at more then double the mortgage amount and the loan to value rate is at least 55% where 20% is all that is needed! Even on the initial for. They sent us they showed the value to be almost double and they still insisted that we need to pay $650 to have an appraisal done. We resisted by gave in to their demands! The appraisal was done and came in at an even higher value but also noted that we were in the process of redoing our backyard including the addition of a pool. Now, we were NEVER asked if we were doing any remodeling PRIOR to us wasting $650 on an appraisal! Now they say. We have to wait and lose our rates until the backyard is finished in October!  Screw that! We will get our refinance through a better source, without an appraisal! BOA should have asked the right questions up front so we would not have to get stressed out and losing $650 to a useless appraisal for clients who have been loyal to them for 25+ years!"
2021-06-29,John,elysium18live,True,Bank of America Car Loans,5,I had refinanced a loan from Ally to Bank of America and let me tell you the entire process was super simple. I already bank with Bofa so as soon as I was approved for the refinance it immediately showed up in my online banking. The only think I didn't really care for was during the refinance process I had to go to the DMV here in NC and get a lean placed on the title. But other than that it was an incredibly smooth process.

Because I was not using the card, I was not monitoring it and was only notified after BofA reported a late payment was reported to the credit bureau. Subsequently, the vendor acknowledged it was an unauthorized charge and refunded me. In the meantime, I paid it before that refund hit so I could get it removed from my credit report. I've now filed 3 disputes with Bank of America and they have not removed it from my credit report even after I told them it's the one late payment I have on my whole account and it's preventing me from getting loans for school. I have also received letters from them saying they need more information from me but when I call they have NO idea what that means, they see the letter, and say they don't know what they need but I can file another dispute. This is the groundhog day of banking and it's potentially keeping me from pursuing my education. They are incompetent, please do not ever use bank of america, especially for a credit card.

I could still be fine with the process but disappointed that BOA wants to save few bucks by using regular mail for mailing to see more documents rather than email, fax, online submission, or even branch visit. I waited for a week to first receive letter which I responded with in an hour. After that it is again stuck. After following up for more than a week, they sent another letter but again with regular post. When I requested to at least send priority email to expedite process they said nothing can be done. I am not sure why BoA believes in slow process. As new prospective customer, I am certainly not gonna recommend or come back again.

2021-06-15,michaeljohnmadrigal,michaeljohnmadrigal,False,Bank of America Checking,5,"This review is long over due and I apologize for that. My partner passed in 2017 and at the time Bank of America notified me that there was still money on a credit card that was to go to me. I called during that time and an assistant promised me she'd take care of everything and get back to me. Months went by and I heard nothing and I couldn't remember who I had spoken with. Then I received a letter from the California State Controller, letting me know that the money was still with Bank of America and I needed to claim it. I called and was told to bring the letter and it would be taken care of. I walking into the Bank of America branch office at 501 Brannan St. SF CA 94107. I had misplaced the letter and called to find out if I really needed it. I was told the bank had a copy and it would be no problem. I walked in and spoke with someone at the desk area. He shook his head and said no we need the letter. I explained that I was told that I didn't need it. Then Namaye Bailey asked me to step into his office. he said he'd try his best to help me resolve this issue. He called someone to look into it and it was difficult because I had very little information. Mr. Bailey stayed on the phone and made great conversation with me when he was on hold. finally, they located the money, and Mr. Bailey actually walked me to the door and I was impressed with the level of customer service I received. Mr. Bailey is a true asset to Bank of America. I was recently considering moving my money to an internet bank, but after this experience there's no way I'll ever leave Bank of America. many thanks to Mr. Bailey for his time and positive energy. A very happy client."

2021-05-28,Deborah,dsteeleomaha,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,4,"I've been rebuilding my credit for several years with only one missed payment on my car loan payment due to starting a new job and only being paid once a month. This after having been unemployed for six months prior to needing a new car. So I've finally built my credit up to the mid 700s, (e.g., 741, 741, and 756) and my credit utilization is 31%. Though I have a very short credit history, I thought I'd have a good shot at getting this card — and I did. The reason I wanted this card is that it offers zero APR on purchases and Balance Transfers for 18 months. Great! After the introductory period, the interest range is 12.99% to 22.99%. I figured I had a shot at getting close to the midpoint of the interest range, but it was not to be. I was shocked that my interest rate is a whopping 22.99%. WTHeck! my secured Discover card had a lower interest rate than this when I first got it three years ago. And at the time, my credit score was in the upper 500s. After six months, I was converted to a regular card at a 18% APR. Yesterday, I negotiated that down to 16%. I'll check back in December to see if they'll lower it again.Ok, back to Bank of America. I requested a $1,534.64 balance transfer to pay off Discover. They only approved $1,200 leaving a $334.64 balance on my Discover card. Now I'm scrambling and am needing to get creative to avoid having to pay two credit card bills every month. Fortunately, I've figured out a way to zero out the remainder of my Discover card balance, but trust when I say this was not an easy endeavor.Once this converts over to the 22.99% interest, other than the introductory 0% APR on Balance Transfers and purchases for the next 18 months, I'll only keep it and use it for extremely small purchases just to show utilization and keep my overall credit utilization ratio low. I'm rating it a 4 because the zero percent introductory offer is great and it serves its purpose. But after that, this card literally bombs because of the high APR they gave me.Of course, everyone's credit profile is different, so if you need to do a balance transfer this offer is for you. But certainly under no circumstances would you ever want to carry a balance on this card unless they gave you a substantially better interest rate."

It’s added as soon as you borrow?

2021-05-23,Not A Fan Of Bank of America,EP123,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,"WARNING FROM A PREVIOUSLY LOYAL CUSTOMER:  I received a $75 annual fee on the BofA Alaska Airlines card that I haven't made a purchase on in over a year.  Because I keep a $0 balance, this annual fee went under my radar, and when I noticed it 30 days after it was due, BofA had already charged late fees on top this annual fee, and reported it to the credit card bureaus, lowering my credit score 80+ points.In this instance, BoA did not have their customer's experience in mind.  Fees on top of fees equates to insult to injury.  There are too many other great competitor cards to deal with BofA's shady business practices."
2021-05-21,Stuart,stuartr_16,True,Bank of America Car Loans,4,Loan is fine. Getting to speak to someone in customer service can be 30-45minute wait.

2021-05-17,Rob Bps,bpsrobin67,False,Bank of America Business Services,1,Speaking to a representative has always been the worst... The wait time isn’t the longest but once you do get the chance to speak to someone; you're juggled off to multiple employees until they figure out who you actually need. Most of the time you get a “sorry try your call again later”. It’s pretty frustrating calling these guys compared to other bankers.

2021-05-13,ejpullem,ejpullem,False,Bank of America Checking,1,I have had Bank of America for 20years. Recently I opened my son an account and experienced the worst service. Customer Service told me to hang up and call back because they couldn't help me. Then told me to go to the office. I show up at the office to be rejected. All we wanted was a debit card to an already opened accout. I am extremely dissatisfied that they were unwilling to help.
2021-05-13,Michelle Lenning,mlenningjd,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"I have banked with Bank of America for the better part of 3 years. I have NEVER had an NSF in that time. Recently, however I failed to add a withdrawal and was short $5 (transaction was $25, I had $19 and some change). I called to find out if as a one time courtesy they would reverse the $35 fee, as I had a pending $200 deposit on the account. Not only was I informed that they would not reverse the one time fee, I was advised that they had returned the transaction. So, for a $5mistake it will cost me over $80 in fees between the bank and the originator. This is not the first time I have received horrible customer service at Bank of America. In October I was hospitalized with Covid in and out through the month of January. My direct deposits weren’t coming in because I was on short term disability which had not posted. Because I did not have any deposits on the account for two months Bank of America charged me a $12 fee on my account.  When I inquired about this again I was denied a reversal. This bank cares NOTHING about the little guy. They should limit their services to Corporate because clearly that’s all they care about."

I booked a plane ticket with Air Canada and they charged me a foreign transaction fee despite the charge being in US dollars. Never in my life have I ever had a foreign transaction fee put on any of my cards for buying an international flight, noting that their policy is they will charge you a foreign transaction fee if the merchant is outside the US which is ridiculous. My sister purchased the same ticket with the same credit card and there was no fee on her purchase so in summary Bank of America is just looking to nickel & dime their customers. Go with Chase"

2021-05-03,angela_best_1,angela_best_1,False,Bank of America Checking,1,I wish I could give them a 0 but not an option. I am only writing this review for others as their business account customer service is outrageous.  Every time I call i'm on hold waiting for call to be answered for 45 min and then I don't even get the business department so they have to transfer me and I have another 45 min wait even though I am calling the direct business number.  Seriously save yourself a lot of stress and do not go with this bank.  It's been like this for the last 5 years. Today I finally closed my account and am so relieved to not have to go through this again. Also their credit card fees through merchant services are outrageous and had a lot of hidden fees.  I was paying $50/month in fees and only have 5 customers (processing about $450 a month).  What a nightmare this has been!
2021-05-02,Ruth Susanto,ruthnatashas,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,I like how the app is easy to manage and transfer balance within. Also how they have banks and atm everywhere. It’s my first credit card so it helps me build my score. I’ve been getting my cash backs since they allow to choose from different areas for 3%  and I chose online shopping (since I shop online a lot).

2021-04-30,monyr1,monyr1,False,Bank of America Checking,1,True money isn't safe with them. If I have hundreds on my account as soon as I get a deposit the money goes down. This time they stole from my son. How can they steal from a kid? BOA shame on you. If I could give you no stars I would. And it's a shame when you call them to discuss the issue. They don't give a care they make it seem like your calculations are wrong. I went to college for MIBC. I bet they don't know what that means. Medical Insurance Biller and Coder. So technically I know my calculations. And this bank is worthless it should be shut down for stealing from people. People who do not know about this bank stay away from them. Trust me you will not like their service. And yes I know what I am talking about. I have been dealing with them for 13 yrs. Reason why I have moved from this bank is because I don't have a car to move to the bank I have in mind. But trust me when I am able I am moving with a smile on my face.

We submitted our application and 3 months later we still hadn't closed. We had a closing scheduled and they called it off one hour in advance, citing a ""technical error"". Turns out the error was our loan officer didn't include my wife's name on the paperwork. The loan officer promised to call the next day and he never did. I called him 3 times on 3 different business days...no response. I called their ""customer care"" line twice and received the same response ""we're going to escalate this...."" and of course, they never called me back. I finally got to speak with the lending agent who told me that the title company has been the issue (not what his fellow employee told me). He said he had trouble checking his voicemail because he gets so many. The lack of professionalism and costumer care has been astounding."

2021-04-26,John Doe,JohnDoe123,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,"Better to avoid, treats loyal customers like a number. I’ve been working with BofA for 10 years and have only gradually been punished as a reward. First they implemented the account maintenance fees that the major retail banks did so I had to close my checking. Now they close my credit card which is the oldest line I had open on my credit as punishment for varied transaction activity / inactivity during the pandemic. Basically feels like BofA is punishing me for COVID so they closed my account. They also refuse to reopen my account. Supposedly they claim I got a letter in the mail, but I clearly never saw it. Also, they do not send email, text, or robo call notifications, so they clearly don’t want to actually have you be aware that your account is closing so much as making the minimum effort to follow procedure and be compliant. I used to root for BofA as an underdog to Chase, but they’ve unfortunately proven me wrong. Better to bank with Chase or your local credit union, BofA, Wells Fargo, Barclay’s and the like lack good technology and loyalty/service to their customers, not worth the time."
2021-04-25,Cherie,cherieh_6,True,Bank of America Mortgages,5,I’ve been with BofA for 23 years. The customer service is good and they gave us our mortgage even when our scores weren’t high. They have refunded overdraft fees many times over the years.

I highly suggest going with a credit union , or any other option if you can. Avoid bank of america."
2021-04-19,Marion,mec1970,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,Great card. Ok rewards. B of A has given me several credit limit increases over the years without asking and has decreased my interest rate as my credit score has improved.

The denial reasons stated I was applying for one of their premium cards (I had not) and that I was in an active bankruptcy (I clearly was not); I appealed and was denied a second time.They didn't approve me until after I'd moved all of my banking activity to the bank across the street (literally), and that was when I had the chance to say, ""Thanks, but no thanks; too little, too late."""

Then they have ""system errors"" every few months where your account will reflect a much higher balance than what's actually there. Today they credited me $1300 (I thought they had FINALLY resolved the repeated transactions just mentioned) but nope, instead they withdrew the funds from my account about two hours later and are now stating I have ten days to pay them or they will take legal action. Btw as a debt collector I happen to know this is a DIRECT violation of udaap regulations, and I will be filing a report against bank of america as well as a lawsuit if this is not resolved"

I called customer service and my call was transferred to multiple people and no one had answers as to why my account was closed. I visited Bank of America in person and even they didn't know why it was closed. After multiple tries, I got to know was that there was some information that was missing in my account. I still don't know what information was missing and why would someone close a bank account if there was a missing information ?? And how did Bank of America keep my account open for 9 years with this missing information if it was so important. There is a better way to handle this scenario rather than just going ahead and closing a customer's bank account without notifying them. It’s really sad that Bank of America treats its customers this way - a customer who has been with them for around 9 years. At least they should have the courtesy to treat their customers in a better way and notify them beforehand if they were taking such a drastic step of closing their account. Very unprofessional and disappointing !"

Met the spending requirement and waited for the 8-12 weeks to pass. No statement credit. Called Bank of America and they pretend that card does not have that bonus. I have saved the opening docs and the card is still offered online with that bonus (and I have never seen it without that bonus), but does not help. Bank of America are complete idiots and useless. They send me a letter to call them back to resolve the issue, but then can't look up the issue code and can't help again. I tell them I have saved the PDF and it clearly documents the bonus, but they don't want to and can not just receive an email. I tell them to just look up the application website, but they cannot type in a URL into a browser. I had two other credit cards with BofA and a checking account. On the second phone call I started my departure from BofA and cancelled one card. On the next call I will cancel the second one. I'm sure this will not resolve and I will cancel all cards and the checking account with BofA. It is OK, they are incompetent anyway. Never seen such a painful process for setting up autopay as with BofA. I do not recommend getting the card. I am forced to give at least 1 star, but would have chosen 0 otherwise."

However, their internal systems can't seem to show the payments applied correctly.  I keep getting called incessantly by their reps to collect “unpaid” statements, except when I point out the letters they sent me where everything is perfect, they apologize lamely but fail to fix the error(s).  They've even recently reported the supposed missed payments to the credit agencies which have caused my credit ratings to drop 100 points.  They are an awful servicer and not competitive on initial rates.  Avoid them unless you have some connection with an internal banker and they are your last resort."

Then if the balance sinks below $1000 they charge you $12 a month. What the hek! This information of course was never disclosed to me and I was told I should have read the fine print. I only used the account to pay my $700 home equity loan why would I keep more money in it? Happy I paid off my mortgage but I will never get back my 4 years worth of $12 monthly charges. Not right and not fair. Never again.

Their web app for credit cards is terribly organized, makes no sense, is still based on the ""bill pay"" paradigm of 20 years ago...if you make a credit card payment on your own, with autopay set up, they aren't smart enough to NOT take the payment a 2nd time.Then, when they DO double dip from your bank account....you will have a credit balance which is impossible to recover.  Their promised checks never arrive in the mail...took me a DOZEN phone calls and 3 months to get a phantom refund check deposited back to my credit card balance and now I'm stuck with a credit balance forever because (a) I don't want to use this card anymore, and (b) I don't trust them to try and mail me a check.Their phone system is intentionally engineered to prevent you from reaching a human being and the counterintutitive steps you have to follow just to remain on hold are insane.The people who do answer the phone are not empowered to help you in any meaningful way.  You have to immediately ask for a supervisor and then the wait times can be interminable.Every single thing about BoA - their credit cards, their bank accounts, their website, their promotional offers - everything - is 3rd rate, bottom of the barrel, complete garbage.

My husband's checks (he worked for the state of AZ in law enforcement) were deposited weekly, my son's ssi benefits (he's severely disabled and the bank said it was fine) and my husband's VA benefits FOR YEARS went into this account. Our yearly income taxes... Deposited into this account also. We're talking 10ish years. Here we are March 2021. Everyone is struggling. BOA just made that struggle worse. My husband lost his job due to a severe back injury. So his checks stopped of course. BOA had no problem taking his retirement and allowing that into his account, but once that money was gone, with ZERO notice started turning away my son's ssi and my husband's VA benefits. Let me make this clear, we got ZERO notice that these payments would be rejected. When we called and asked why, their heavily accented customer service rep said ""we don't allow deposits into this account for anything other than your state of AZ paychecks""?? when my husband said ""wait, we've had these things deposited for years"" the rep just said ""well, we don't allow it. Byyeee"". Bank Of America, we can't make rent while we try to scramble to obtain the checks that you ""never allowed"". You are a dirty, greedy, garbage company that doesn't care about its customers. You've turned away disability benefits and veterans benefits. A company that will do that with no notice... Don't take your chance with them."

My score was 720ish 2 yrs ago when I got this card and I only got $1k limit. I asked for credit limit increase several times and they said I don’t have long enough relationship with them. I have couple other credit cards with 10-15k credit limit, not sure why they could only give me $1k. I’ve been paying off each time. My credit is now in the 820+. They finally increased my limit by $500 not too long ago. Tempted to close it since kind of useless as I already have other cards now where I earn cash or miles too and have higher limit.... but WalletHub says my score will go down a lot if I do, so keeping it just as a little back up and will use it for online shopping only rather than for everyday stuff."

Just recently they called me personally on Saturday 3/13/21 about my application, explained to him what was going on. Then cancel my application on Monday 3/15/21 due failure to provide documentation. When I have provided every document they requested for not just 2019, I provided it for 2020 as well. Then when I called to inquire, expressed my concerns and when I wanted to file a complaint or speak with someone I was transferred to the general customer service cue. This has been a horrible experience, when I have submitted my applications weeks before the deadline and can not receive any help during the paramedic in which the bank received funding to help.

It appears that the Disservice employees that work in the dispute department do not read or even look at the documents that are submitted by their customers for the dispute. BoA dispute employees grab out of thin air whatever reason that pops into their head to disallow the dispute for their customer without ""investigating"" or even reading their customer's documents.  BoA treats a customer that has over $10,000 in their account as a customer not worthy of a dispute ""because they have money"". I have had 3 disputes that if the Disservice BoA employee would have simply read my documentation they would have seen the company I have a dispute with is committing fraud and NOT honoring their own written and stated policies. I return the product as told to do by the company. SO now I am out the products and the money! Thanks for crapping all over me BoA. I am closing all my accounts with BoA for that reason and moving to a CC company that cares about its customers and has its customers back, Not a poorly rated online rip of stores, that lies to its customers, lied to the dispute investigator, working the dispute process. I am done being discriminated against by BoA because my bank account is higher than $10,000. BoA thinks and feels I don't deserve the same customer service as other customers that have lower account balances.

Credit unions have virtually no minimum balance, overdraft protection among many other free features and better interest rates. Credit unions actually pay you to hold your money. Yes you even earn an interest rate on checking accounts. Whereas today most people pay banks to hold their money with minimum balance fees, atm fees, checkbook charges etc. etc. Most credit unions provide all the same services big banks offer and are very easy to join.

I have a BOA home loan and worked with Kevin Moores NMLS 492522. Kevin made this experience horrible and purposely would not respond or answer questions for clarity to lead me to assume that everything is ok. Tomorrow is my closing date and today after asking Kevin, for days about my loan estimate and to see if it is updated with correct info, he finally sent it to me and I felt tricked. I knew that up until closing the interest rate can change and me and him verbally locked in a 2.5% interest rate but he just informed me that I will be at a 3.5% interest rate of which I asked him to elaborate on 12/29/2020 but he never did. Believing that it was an APR or will be changed by closing and not hearing back from Kevin about it, I proceeded to believe it would be resolved and Kevin would tell me that I am not qualified for that program if I really wasn’t. Kevin never informed me about the rate going up. I believed it couldn’t automatically be switched to another program unless I approved it. I told Kevin… “I will be happy to move forward with BOA but want to make sure the concession is included and would like to see it in the LE.” I never approved this program, me saying I will be happy to move forward was stating if updates are in the LE which included my buyers concession and new insurance quote are correct, I will move forward, not that I agree with this deal. I would rather have my 2.5% interest rate. Kevin informed me that my loan process was approved on 2/16/2021, that’s two days before he sent me the updated 3.5% interest rate, of which also led me to believe that my interest rate was locked in at 2.5% still. He didn’t state in that email anything about PMI 3.5% or anything else. I reached out to Kevin’s manager Johnathan Giles-Morgan via email and voicemail about my concerns with Kevin and the loan. HE NEVER REACHED BACK OUT TO ME. Instead he told Kevin I reached out and Kevin did nothing at all. I wanted to speak with Johnathan and express my bad service but nothing happened.I do feel neglected, disrespected, ignored and tricked. I was lured in asked questions, reached out to higher management, even had other parties reach out to Kevin on my behalf but instead of him communicating, he left me with no choice but to accept a 3.5% interest rate. I can accept this or be completely homeless if I don’t sign and agree to this loan. He ignored all the right questions and never expressed change in my loan within less than 24 hrs before me closing.

I do not feel that they reciprocate their customers for the use of our money compared to what they are willing to offer.  I also have a credit card with a 500 limit and I travel a lot.  I asked to have the limit increased due to the fact that maxing out a card with a low limit has detrimental affects on my credit rating.  When I stopped using their card, they cancelled my credit with them.  I also met with them to discuss a home equity loan and was deterred from this as well.  This begs the question of why I even bank with a bank that offers few financial benefits?  It is like a bad relationship.  I am actively looking to their competitors for better service."

Therefore, I am unable to get the pay-off information on the mortgage and the title company will not want to handle the transfer of title without that information.  Thus, I am unable to sell my mother's house and pay for her care facility.  I find this policy to be ridiculous since I never had control of the original document and their actions are creating a substantial financial hardship on my mother who is no longer capable of caring for herself.  I am in the process of retaining an attorney to force Bank of America to accept the POA.

They like to tell you that's just how it works, but I spoke with someone at my other bank and they said it was not actually true and that if the money clears their bank the other bank has it.

2021-01-13,Jay F Alipit,jfalipit,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"Nope! Extreme failure. This bank can't even handle a timely deposit of a Cashiers Check. When you create a Cashier's Check, you withdraw the entire amount for the check, Pay one of the highest fees possible for a transaction outside of a massive money wire, you state who the payee and payer parties are to the transaction and thats that. Businesses across the country state that if the transaction is not to be in cash, a cashiers check or certified funds like a cashiers check are required. For example a home purchase, car purchase, a business transaction. Our case was sadly something quite personal and tragic. The massive inconvenience and situation a simple transaction can cause a family, just because a bank can’t do the most simple thing in 2021. Teller says, cash will be available the next day. Nope. Holding for two weeks. No funds available. If a bank cannot handle the deposit of a cashiers check, do business elsewhere. Bank of America is not in any way deserving of your hard earned dollars. In this case a check that is certified and forever have been considered cash in hand. I guess not. I have personal checks deposited that will clear faster. No more. Pathetic. And to think our family was considering putting substantial amounts of money in for college funds and trusts, forget about it. Bank of America, OFF THE LIST. Would be ZERO stars if possible."
2021-01-13,Dylan Hoover,DHoover,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"For the past couple of years, I've been having my card declined for specious activity when I've had more than enough funds to cover my transaction. It happens at least once every 2-4 weeks. It can be at a store around the corner from my house, or a store around the corner from where I work. I’ve checked my security settings online and made sure my address is correct. It's highly embarrassing, and I'm absolutely sick of it. I'm trying so hard not to switch banks mainly because of the hassle of it all. I've contacted customer service several times, I've stayed on the phone for an hour waiting to talk to somebody only to get disconnected and to start over. I've talked to the Fraud department twice. The first guy, Max, tried to accuse me of not knowing how to use a debit card. I was very offended. But ultimately he said it could be a bad chip on the card and he sent me a new card with the same numbers so that I wouldn't have to go through the hassle of changing everything. Unfortunately, he didn't keep my security code the same. Well that card is now gone and if I need to provide my security code, well I just can't make that purchase. If you talk to Max tell him thanks for nothing. Actually, he made the situation slightly worse. I called Fraud a second time only to be told there's nothing they could do since I confirmed all the previous transactions and my card was active. Well, here I am again. This morning my card was declined, literally around the corner from my work. The only thing I know to do is suck it up, dump BOA, tell my story on anything and everything so that others won't fall for their terrible customer service. I'm sorry. But this is ridiculous. Like I said before, it's embarrassing when it happens. And I'm absolutely done."

The banker that opened my account failed to mention the stipulation that my account would be charged $12 monthly unless I had a certain amount deposited in one transaction each month. I am a server, so my checks are not that large and I probably wouldnt have taken this account if I knew I would be charged monthly. A few months in, I deal with some fraud on my account to the tune of $40, which I call and deal with, but my claim eventually got overturned and they gave the money back to the scammers. Now, I closed my account months ago, but with this stimulus check coming out, the irs sent my check to good old boa. They rejected the check, sent me no notice, and have no info online about what happens in my situation where closed accounts get sent checks, so I call and wait on hold for 30 minutes to deal with the rudest employee they have, whom informs my boa cant accept payments once an account is closed (which is not true, my fiance's old bank sent him his check).

Today, I spoke with four different people and the wait time was two hours.  Unfortunately, my issue did not get resolved.  I paid off my credit card balance twice in error and have been waiting more than two weeks to get the second payment back.  How long should it really take to transfer $$ between my accounts?

2021-01-08,Mariana,mariana_soria,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"I have banked with Bank of America since I opened my first account 6 years ago and I have never had an issue here. I usually get an email if my account is at or below $25 which allows me to take care of things before I overdraft and therefore have never had an overdraft fee. On 01/06/2021 I was charged an overdraft fee but did not get notified of the overdraft fee or the $25 balance until 01/07/2021 at 1238. I decided to call customer service and see if they were willing to refund the fee as I have heard most banks do especially if it's the first occurrence. I spoke to a gentleman at 2:06 pm and explained the situation. The man proceeded to ask "" Is it the bank's fault you got an overdraft fee"" after again explaining that I have never had an issue receiving notification and this time had not received one until after the money had been withdrawn he asked, ""Well why didn't you sign up for the overdraft protection"". This man was extremely rude and made me feel very disrespected. A simple "" no ma'am we are unable to refund the fee"" would have been okay. I felt the attitude displayed toward me was unprofessional, unnecessary, and degrading. After today's incident, I cannot recommend Bank of Americal to any of my friends or family. As a 6 year customer of this institution, I am severely disappointed at the unprofessional behavior and poor service I received. Today's display is making me consider taking my business to another financial institution."

They have pulled my monthly mortgage payment three times in the last month and every time I call for a correction (a refund of MY money that THEY incorrectly pulled from my bank account), the task is apparently impossible. They can see that they have pulled my payment three times; they can see that it is not my fault; they can see that it is something with their system; yet having them do a simple reversal of the funds cannot happen. I have spent countless hours on the phone and the issue is not resolved. They are very concerned to get their money, but not so much concerned to return it when they take it in error. I will never do business with them again. Stay away from their home mortgages unless you can afford three mortgage payments to be taken out of your account in the span of 30 days."

They do not care about you as an individual. They do not care what your circumstances were or currently are. That mentality trickles down from the top to the bottom. Very and I mean very few are actually there to try and work FOR YOU and care about YOU but can only do so much due to how BOA runs things. You’re better off trying to go to a credit union and banking with them. Look for local credit unions who actually are there to serve you.

2020-12-10,rockinmarilyn,rockinmarilyn,False,Bank of America Business Services,4,"I love what this card did for me. My credit score was 548 and it is now 740. Believe it Or not I did this in 6 months. I would have rated it a 5 star but I have to agree that many times I call and they don’t know how to handle my request. I wanted to keep increasing my credit limit by placing an additional deposit which you can do with B of A BANKAMERICARD. You cannot do that with Capital One Secured and I have them both. But since the card is specialized I only wish there was a group that handled only secured card inquiries. That is the only downfall of my score. Since I manage the card and payoff most of it always then the higher interest is not a dealbreaker. The flip side of my excellent service is this... I got approved which is my first plus. If you have bad or no credit it is a rough beginning but I already banked with them for 30 years or so. Establish a bank account is a great suggestion though even if it’s new it creates a great relationship with B of A. So I started with $200 and I added an additional $400 in the first 6 months so I had $600 CL. The reps are helpful and nice again just not always understanding the secured side of it. I paid on time and several times a month. I would pay a small amount. I would leave a small balance but my credit utilization between both cards was usually 4-6%. Since Cap One gave me automatic increase and I had B of A longer I decided to contact them at 7 months. I wanted an increase and find out how long before my card would be unsecured. This rep was right on the money. Although he couldn’t guarantee anything he literally asked how much I wanted. I only needed $1,000 unsecured. He informed ahead of time that it is only a soft inquiry. Another bonus. After 7 months with the one call I was immediately refunded my deposit of $600, given the $1,000 unsecured approval, and it was a soft inquiry. I stayed focused on the information I received through Credit Wise which is like all the credit karmas out there but since it is with Capital One and I got their secured card I followed the rules and steps in Credit Wise. I really hope this helps you. I really kept reading the reviews with Wallet Hub. Their suggestions and information from people like us are helpful. If at all possible stay away from those monthly Billings like First Premier if at all possible. That is a costly road and I worked hard to try and not do that. B of A and Cap One secured is the direction I went. I felt those financial institutions really catapulted my success with my credit score. Also if you or someone in your family are in the military, highly recommend Navy Federal Credit Union. They have low interest cards, will approve on bad/fair credit and little credit history. Although I didn’t have the secured card they also have a cash rewards secured card. I was just approved for unsecured $1,000 CL with cash rewards. 2021 is looking brighter already."

Bank of America was there to only tell me, that this is a business (Erica Solution Supervisor) she went on to tell me that they have to protect themselves. I was hurt, blown away and lost for words. I have been a customer of Bank of America, for over 13 years. Also, to be advised that I would have to run my credit again, in order for them to assist me. I couldn't believe it! All I can say is, is that I'm disappointed in how I was treated! Loyalty means nothing to Bank of America, when times are hard. You are only a Valued Customer.

Then after going a couple of rounds with the AI, it gives up and sends you to a representative, which is great, but be warned, the AI will be talking in your ear the ENTIRE time.

2020-12-02,Ron Davis,RPaulD,False,Bank of America Mortgages,1,"My experience has been atrocious. When we first started our mortgage, we turned around all document requests in 24 hours or less. I said I was worried about missing our purchase contract date and losing our home, since it was in a very hot neighborhood in Seattle and we had gotten a great deal. I was continuously reassured that we would not miss the date. They missed it. We got an extension and they missed it again. Fortunately, our sellers were out of town and we lucked out; they didn’t want to open back up for more offers (the house had been discovered by then). We could have lost the house.Now, four years later, I'm trying to refinance (with another lender, thank goodness). I’ve had eight hours over the course of a month or more on the phone with this place. I had a Covid deferral that needed to be paid off. I couldn’t pay it directly, so I had to get it “moved to the front.” I paid the $9k. The funds were “unapplied.” I had to call in again, they “released” them, sent a new payoff letter. Poof! There was a new $3800 payment for Covid I needed to make, and it showed that my regular payment was late (It wasn’t; I paid it on time). Both my regular payment and my escrow payment went to “unapplied funds.” So I called in again, went through the phone tree and got them both “applied.” Except I didn’t. The $3800 still wasn’t applied. So I called in again. After my fourth or fifth experience escalating to the centralized escalation team (or a manager, depending), I had to ask them to do it again. A manager named Erin this time said she would do it and call me in the morning to confirm whether it had happened. I said, “I need your number so I can be sure I won’t get left hanging.” “Sorry, we don’t have one; we are inbound only. I will definitely call you.” Surprise! She didn’t. Surprise! The $3800 still isn’t applied. Also, my current escalation manager says the previous folks left no documentation. I’m now being told I should talk to a new department. Maybe they will be able to help…I cannot wait until this is over. I will pull my $60k from my accounts and terminate this toxic 20 year relationship."

I can not easily find the phone number to call on their customer portal, I had to Google ""how to speak to a real person BOA"". The whole process fucking sucks and is retarded. If you treat your customers like this no one will want to bank with you. Fucking fix your piece of shit website, I cannot easily set up AutoPay without literally calling someone about what to do. Try setting up AutoPay yourself and you will see what I mean."

I asked for a manager and finally gave up holding after almost 15 minutes. I've been a long time customer but cannot WAIT until I can get all my banking switched to another bank that wont leave me stranded at night due to a ridiculous policy that was hidden vs. made sure to be communicated in multiple ways to fully prepare customers of the change.

After almost 2 months of waiting, calling constantly, filing police reports, lots of tears and frustration, etc., I got my answer from Bank Of America.They approved the Cash App claim but denied the Zelle claim. Huh?! How do you come up with 2 different outcomes for the exact same issue?? If you are with Bank Of America or thinking about using them, I urge you to go with a smaller bank that actually gives a shit about you. And before anyone says, 'I've been with them for years, and I've been very happy', please know that I've been with them for over 20 years now. I have never once had an issue, but the first time something happens to where I need their support after supporting their institution for 20 over years, I get nothing. Their denial letter told me to contact the person I sent the money to, which tells me they didn't even read the details of my claim before denying it or they would have seen that I didn't send money to anyone!Whatever.

No problem for years, then in July, acct# was changed so principal only payment goes into ‘unapplied funds for 4-5 days but when it reflects against my balance, the date is the actual receipt date (10/25) Once it posted after the 1st of the next month. This means interest is calculated on the higher balance. Is this some kind of interest scam? I plan to confirm everything for the next 2 payments and file a complaint with my state AG for investigaton.

2020-10-15,Ashur Khan,ashur_khan4,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,"On June 8th, 2020 there were two unauthorized charges on my Bank of America account. One charge was for $57.55 from MenuStar, a company that doesn't even service my area, and the other was from DoorDash for a restaurant named Buona, where I've never eaten in my life, for $36.12. I called the company within a couple of days, and by June 9th, there was a credit on my account for these two charges and a fraud investigation had been started. My card was canceled and a new card was sent out to me. On July 8th, 2020 the credits were reversed. The company sent me a letter telling me that the orders from these services came from my device and that they match my previous account activity. I reached out to DoorDash who confirmed this was fraud, and they refunded me $36.12. I also contacted MenuStar who confirmed that the transaction was fraud, but all they need is for BOA to reach out to them notifying them that a fraud claim was submitted. The bank doesn't want to contact the vendor for some reason, and therefore I'm stuck with the amount of $57.55. I am still in possession of the card that was used, so I was not negligent in any way. Somehow these criminals got a hold of my card, and I don't want to finance their food or lifestyle. Bank of America needs to make this right. They have a $0 liability guarantee which should be applied in this scenario. I get an e-mail from Vernon White who never answers his phone or returns my calls to confirm my complaint with the CFPB. This avoidance is totally unethical and a way for BOA to work around the CFPB. At this point this is impacting my credit score, and it's not okay. I contacted the fraud department and asked to speak with a manager, and they said someone would call me, and it has almost been a week and no phone call. AVOID BOA! Tell your friends and family to avoid them at all costs. They are thieves."

So why go through all that trouble to make the account and print the card and activate it to have the account shut down not even 8 hours after opening it. NOT A GOOD BANK TO GO WITH. If they want me to take this down, I would be happy to with a sincere apology and serve me with an account that will not get closed. But till then, this is the worst bank.

This in turn affected my available credit and thereby affected my credit score. When I called to get it resolved I was told that they could not open my credit card back up and that I could reapply if I wanted to.

I called 800-652-1111 in an attempt to override via a customer service rep with no luck and the checks were automatically processed w/o approval. The headache continued when I tried to cancel and was unable to do so when I called back since there was a pending order I could not continue and was disconnected. Finally was routed to a live agent when transferred directly over from customer service, 800-432-1000 number but was told they need to speak to her. Called my MIL from my other phone and put on speakerphone, but no third party calls allowed...UGH! She cannot do this on her own and I am not able to get to her home to help her. The woman at check reorder told me to call back customer service...another 10 minute wait now and they probably won't be of help.

Being disconnected after more than 30 minutes on hold and having to begin the process again, is common.  I do like that you can get 3% cash back on the category of your choice but that extra 1% isn't worth the hassle of dealing with Bank of America.  If you love Bank Of America seek professional help but if you're one of those B of A customers who truly love them, this is a great card for you.  If you've not relationship with Bank of America -- Avoid establishing one."

Bank Of America has a relationship with Zelle even though they themselves will say that they have more fraud complaints regarding Zelle recently than ever before. I'm guessing the kickback they receive from Zelle is worth much more to them than their customers' business, so it's ok if a bunch of people lose their money, as long as Bank Of America gets theirs.

AND you can become a fraud victim even if you've never used Zelle, which happened to me! I was a customer up until yesterday for over 20 years, and the first time I actually needed them for somepthing, they showed their true colors, and I lost over $3000 b/c they just don't care.

I hope that they have not stolen money from me, but have no way to be sure, as they will not give me the simple thing I have been requesting--my Escrow Analysis Statement--which they emailed me was available by logging into my account--which they will not give me access to.  I have even filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau to try and get them to do something that would literally take them 1 minute to provide. Don't bank with BOA, as they do not care about their customers.  Making me spend probably 10 hours trying to get a simple statement (that already exists) is unfair, and terrible business practice.

We have to spend hours with customer service over multiple calls, who keep promising us that the error will be fixed, before it is finally escalated and the charge made in error is reversed. Having a system glitch once, I understand. How can you have the same system glitch another month? And how do you not escalate the issue the first time when we are talking about a few thousand dollars every month that you wrongly took from us? How do you not get it fixed immediately when it is your error?We had a mortgage with Wells Fargo before we refinanced with BoFA and our experience with Wells Fargo was so much better. Bank of America really needs to step up its software and system.BoFA's software and customer service is really terrible. We had a person we could contact for any mortgage related issues in Wells Fargo, but at BoFA, you are stuck with their automated customer service which can put you on hold for hours.

Predatory banking is widespread at BOA. I would recommend you take your money elsewhere. Despite Covid 19 and 2 recent overdrafts from transactions posted months ago, (which likely BOA had already charged a $35 fee on) they would not reverse the error - only automatic attempts by the system and no upper supervisor oversight. Hope they Boa heads have a great time enjoying their $70 profit at the expense of the poor in this country."

2020-09-22,Olga Sunitsky,olgasunitsky,False,Bank of America Mortgages,1,"My mortgage gets automatically drafted every two weeks. Since they switched to a new system in August, they keep holding the money that got drafted in Unapplied Funds and don't apply it to my mortgage payment. The September statement shows my payment as late, even though every payment was made. I have spent many, many hours on the phone and sent them several messages through their on-line system. They refuse to stop drafting money automatically and they won't apply it to my mortgage. I am considering some legal options in dealing with them. They hang up on me after I am on hold for hours, keep transferring me to someone else or assign me a case ID number, and then do absolutely nothing about it. The people who pick up the phone cannot apply payment from unapplied funds to the mortgage payment and they cannot remove the automatic payment plan. Since this is their mortgage customer service, I am wondering what it is that they actually CAN do besides keep customers on hold for hours on end and transfer them to each other. I am keeping meticulous records of all my phone calls and hold times in case I actually have no choice and need to report them to the Department of Banking or pursue some legal action to resolve this."

2020-09-23,Olga Sunitsky,olgasunitsky,False,,0,"@krisnoah Kristina, I am so sorry you are going through this too. It seems that today they finally did apply some of my payments to the mortgage, but not all of them. I still have some money sitting in ""unapplied funds"". Moreover, they applied one of the payments directly to the principal amount, so now I have to pay additional half of the monthly payment amount this month towards the mortgage in order to meet the full monthly mortgage payment amount for October. It's a total mess. 
I gave up any hope of fixing this completely. I'm just trying to control the damage until I can refinance and leave them. As long as they post my payment into anything, principal or monthly payment, I'll consider it a win, as long as they don't keep holding on to my money in ""unapplied"" funds and stop drafting more out of my account without my permission. 
I wish I could tell you that there is a way to resolve this with them without hiring an attorney, but unfortunately at this point I don't trust them at all. I suggest you do speak with your attorney about this ASAP, before they get a chance to ruin your credit over the mistakes their IT department made. 
One thing I learned - calling them is useless. You'll just waste your time on hold. I suggest you keep posting them messages through their site daily until they do something. And do contact your attorney in the meantime. 
Best of luck, Kristina! I do hope it will work out for you soon. Let me know what happens."

Maybe it's worth explaining in the email that holding on to people's payments and not posting it to their mortgage accounts could potentially result in a class action lawsuit and investigations by various government agencies. Ruining someone's credit history with negative reports, despite the fact that the customer paid on-time could also result in lawsuits and investigations into their negligent practices. This is a system-wide issue created by their IT department in August 2020. I feel like someone very senior needs to get involved in resolving this.

2020-09-15,steadyfish24_wallethub,steadyfish24_wallethub,False,Bank of America Mortgages,1,"I found the mortgage team I worked with very unprofessional and am extremely dissatisfied. There were multiple issues throughout the process and every time I just had to accept what loan officers (and their managers) prescribed or else I would need to go get the mortgage elsewhere. Specific issues:1. Rate lock without consent: The loan officer locked the rate without my consent. When I reached out to the his manager to intervene she offered a solution - I go to some other bank (she'll reimburse me for the appraisal costs incurred so far) or I stay with BofA and the rate stays locked. Being just 2 weeks from my closing date, I had no other alternative but to go with the rate that the loan officer locked without my consent.2. Lack of communication: About 10 days prior to my scheduled closing date, I asked for closing early by 3 days. Loan officer responded saying - I see no issues why we can't. After that I sent multiple emails to the loan officer, loan coordinator and their managers for an update but the next meaningful update I received from them was at 7 PM on the day before closing - At that point they needed more documents from me. Eventually, they closed my loan on Aug 31st after I waited at the title company's office for an hour.3. Bait and switch: The loan officer promised a lower lender origination fees ($785) but told me on the day of my closing that it would be $1135. The explanation: the original quote was for a single family home and he realized on the day of closing that I'm purchasing a condo and hence higher fees. The resolution: On the day of closing when I'm waiting at the title company's office to sign papers, the loan officer calls me, tells me that the fees will be higher and he'll clear the loan only if I accept the higher origination fees otherwise he won't.I have been a BofA customer for 9 years and I am soon going to move to some other bank for the bulk of my banking needs."

That happened to me twice in this pandemic and it is ridiculous since I've been trying to unlink my BoA account from that service for days. And yet the bank has the gut to tell me that I should stop taking advantage of them waiving fees (they waived the two first after I called twice) when they're the ones taking advantage of people. Disgusting. Not to mention the fact that they charge a monthly fee for god knows what. Also, today I was trying to transfer some money between my Chase accounts, and I did it so fast that I mistakenly transferred to my BoA account... these a*holes want to charge me $30 to get MY MONEY BACK.

I was really upset after they closed my last one and decided to call they and none of the reps knew what to tell me so they kept transferring me around. I finally spoke to a Supervisor and explained my situation and told him that I either needed a valid reason why my cards were cancelled or needed them to reopen one of my cards. The ""Supervisor"" very rudely told me that they have the right to close my account for whatever reason and that they will not be reopening any of my accounts.

Our families (10 people) had to sleep on the floor (our furniture was in our moving truck) of our 2 bedroom apartment because of this delay.

Was in the middle of setting up a primary checking, savings, personal credit cards, business account, getting a secondary real estate loan, and setting up several investment programs. Was disconnected from the representative. Called back in to finish setting up these accounts. As expected, reached another representation on the second call. Asked if it was possible to be transferred to the original representative I was speaking to, so I did not have to restate the purpose of the accounts and the goals for each. The second representative did not know if that was possible and after 40 mins waiting (I could have set up the accounts by this time), he finally reached out to a supervisor to ask if he had the ability to transfer the call. He told me the supervisor had no desire to look into this and didn't even want to speak with me. As a new, potential customer, this was eye-opening to me that I wasn't worth their time. Ultimately, I was transfer to ANOTHER person in their sales department to set up these accounts. After spending an additional 30 mins on the phone, I was disconnected AGAIN. After burning the calories in an effort to do business with Bank of America for over 1.5 hours and the blatant disrespect by the escalation team, I gave up.

They closed my account due inactivity, which I understand is in the agreement, what i dislike is they gave me ZERO notice. I have had other cards give a notice that if a card isn't used they will close the account so of course I make a purchase and then pay it off. Its covid i had an excellent score and was trying to refinance my house for the best rate I could get and this will affect that. Sorely disappointed! The kicker is I actually work in a breast cancer center !"

2020-08-24,Terry B,homebasics2,False,Bank of America CDs,1,Having to wait 3 hours on hold to talk to someone when your banks are closed due to covid 19.  We opted to cash out a CD.  They told us they have to send a check and it will take 7 to 10 days.  Fourteen days later we still do not have OUR FUNDS.  So we are calling to see where our money is and call wait time is 3 hours.  What a waist of my valuable time.  Bad customer service. We have been a customer for 15 years.  We will move everything to another bank that cares about service.
2020-08-24,flyingnow2001,flyingnow2001,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,2,Screwed my credit rating. I had a Bank of America credit card I don’t often use. One day I decided to use it to prevent them from closing the credit line as often happens. After never getting a bill several months later I get notification from one of the credit monitoring companies stating I had a bad report after 25 years of great credit. I always get a paper bill but it never arrived. I guess they enrolled me in paperless without telling me. Kind of a low blow because i know if it was USAA they would have contacted me before sending a late report!

2020-08-18,stuartb421,stuartb421,True,Bank of America Mortgages,1,So prior to the 2008 financial meltdown my wife and I use to be faithful customers to BoA for over 10 years. Since the gov't bail out of financial institutions we have noted the online customer service has declined to new lows as it is virtually impossible to get a person on line through their automated system. Of course do not forget the 30-60 minute wait time. This is all because I have an automated mortgage payment that was set up prior to the mess and just recently received a bill in the mail indicating that I need to make the mortgage payment due to an upgrade on their system.  AAARRRGGGHHH! This is my problem because as they clearly indicate if payment is not received by such date there will be a late fee charged to the account. Needless to say we need to add a late fee for their aggravation and lack of service.

Cancelled all credit card, closed savings and checking account and took ALL my banking business to OBee Credit Union that offered better service, higher rates on savings and checking account, better credit card rates and over all was a much better place to leave my money.  BOA has grown so BIG that even trying to talk to someone is a hassle and time consuming just trying to get past the ROBO operator and then being put on hold 20-30 minutes.

I went back to another state to get my dorm stuff and got stuck there and couldn't make a payment in time. I spoke to two of the rep and one is a manager  located in Montana. She could have very well accepted my request. Now I understand why this bank is being hated so much. A small simple gesture I would have kept my account for life.

I have a 780 credit score with perfect payment history.  See a pattern here?  When BofA anticipates tough times ahead they prepare to protect themselves from defaults by cutting back the credit they have out there.  Remember when a bank said they are there for you....NOT BofA, they are only there when it's good for them.  They will leave you high and dry when you need it most.

2020-07-18,wrightwayllc,wrightwayllc,False,Bank of America Mortgages,1,"I had a several accounts with Bank of America in good standing. They serviced my mortgage for years. I always paid ahead on my mortgage.A school board decided to condemn my property. I fought against the condemnation. I decided to pay off my mortgage. When asked for a payoff amount, the the balance was about $8000 high.I went to my branch manager to inquire. After a few weeks, it was determined that the school had made multiple inquiries into the mortgage and the fees for the inquiries had accumulated to approximately $8000. For those who have never had property ""taken"" (condemned) it is an unpleasant experience that has very few rights for you, the condemnee. The School, condemnor, is responsible for paying their fees, by law to keep what happened to me and my family from occurring.Bank of America reassigned the branch manager and informed me that I had to pay off the balance to close the mortgage and I should ask the school to return the funds. They refused to address that their charges were against the law. The school declined to return the funds. I have pursued the matter for years. Though we have repeatedly won court cases, and it was proven the School acted in bad faith, the funds remain tied up in the court cases that are continually extended. I can only hope that my heirs might eventually get the refund.I always fear organizations, like Bank of America, that are willing to impose their burdens, illegally, for their profit, at the cost of their customers and that their customers have to fight for their rights. I hope this helps your decision making."
2020-07-16,Steven Kaiser,skaiser41657,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"On July 14th 2020, I opened a new checking and savings account with Bank of America using the online method available on their website.  I followed all the instructions and answered all questions truthfully.  At the conclusion of the process I was asked to wait while my application was being reviewed for approval.  Shortly after a message popped up stating that my new accounts were approved.  I was provided a link to download their app to my phone.  I downloaded the app, opened it on my phone and logged into my new account.  As I reviewed the features I learned that I could deposit checks by taking a picture of them.  I decided to use this feature to deposit my last two payroll checks.  I followed the instructions and successfully deposited both checks.  I then wrote “Deposited” on both checks per the instructions from the app.  I was informed there was a hold on the checks which I expected but due to the fact these were payroll checks I was not anticipating the hold period would be more than a couple of days.  I logged out of my account.Later I logged back into my account and was told that I am locked out of the account and given an 800 number to call.  I called the number and was informed I needed to call back during business hours.  I made the second phone call on July 15th and after a lengthy wait was told that my account was reviewed by a second person. This person decided to close my new account for suspicion of identity theft, something like that.  I was told my only remedy was to go into an actual Bank of America branch and open a new account to replace my closed new account.  I asked about how the banks were operating during the virus crisis and only then was I told that I needed to make an appointment first.  No appointments were available that day but I was able to schedule one on the 16th at 1:30pm.  Because I have a one hour commute to work, I had to miss three hours of work for which I will not get paid.  You see, I had been unemployed the previous 6 months.  This was my third week on a new job and I had to ask for time off without pay to make this appointment.I arrived at my appointment, explained my situation, she looked at my account and didn’t know what to do.  Her supervisor looked at the screen and told her to call the number on it.  She called and was put on hold for quite a while, finally spoke to someone that told her they would transfer her call to the correct department, and put her back on hold again.  Finally she spoke to someone and when she hung up she told me the following:-	She was going to have to open a new account for me.-	The checks I deposited were going to be held until July 22nd.-	The only way to get the money I deposited into my original new/closed account, transferred to the new account she was going to open today was to make another appointment for the 22nd.  At this appointment someone would call this other department and verify that I was at the appointment and then my money would be released into my new account..I explained to the lady helping me about the issue of missing work on a new job plus not getting paid for what I missed.  I was told there was nothing she could do, it had to be this way, and asked if I wanted the new account?  I told her I need my money and I need an account so reluctantly because I don’t have any choice at this point , yes I want a new account.  She starts the process and stops to inform me that there will be a $100 charge to open the new account.  I told her that they had enough (all except for the $300 in my wallet) of my money and they weren't getting any more.  She went back to her supervisor to see how they could waive the fee only to return and tell me that I had to pay it.  That was it for me and I sad no I don’t want an account but I do want my money back.  How do I get my money?  She said that I would be sent a cashier’s check sometime after July 22nd.All I did was attempt to open a new account, in good faith with Bank of America and in return look at the damages I’ve suffered.-	my payroll income has been taken from me with no definitive answer as to when Bank of America will return my money.-	The new account was going to provide me with the ability to let my employer use direct deposit for my pay.  So, even though the first two checks were tied up I would have this week’s pay getting deposited into the account I tried to open.   Now, I have to wait until next week to get another check.  -	Missed time at work without pay-	I will now have a few bills that will not get paid on time.  That means late fees for me strictly because Bank of America took my money.-	Explain this, I was told I had to be at the bank in person on the 22nd to get my money released into a new account.  But now, they are just going to send it to me?  How does this make any sense at all?  It doesn’t, as obviously, in the end, it wasn’t that important after all.-	And finally, the humiliation, lack of respect and absolutely no concern or compassion for me as a human being I was subject to by Bank of America’s treatment is shocking.  Not once did anyone enquire about any hardships I might experience as a consequence of their actions.  In fact, they wanted another $100, no exceptions, to open an account, which by the way I opened the same account online for free!  Through this whole experience I feel the message is clear, “Mr. Kaiser you are a small little insignificant person and we are big, bad, Bank of America.  We can do whatever we want to you and there is nothing you can do about it.  We stole your money and there is nothing you can do about it.  We want more of your money so that you can have the privilege of having an account with us and there is nothing you can do about it.”  Well, they were wrong about that because I chose not to give then another $100 and I would never do business with an entity that treats people the way I've been treated."

It is very clear that all they care about is money and do NOT care about their customers at all. They don't treat their customers like human beings and are really rude. I was a victim of a scam and they had to close by checking account. The whole time I was on the phone with them, they were treating me like I was some type of criminal and for some reason they sent my cashiers check (with the money that was left in my account) in the mail to an address that I had lived in over 6 years ago. They tried to tell me that was the address they had on file, but I had definitely changed the address on file and been receiving letters from Bank of America at my new and current address. Do not bank with them! They also have bad security features since my credit/debit card has been hacked multiple times. My family has been a customer for over 20 years and I over 7 years and now, they will definitely not get anymore business from me or anybody from my family. Unbelievable."

Wife was penalized for being responsible. 20 year customer, started with $4k limit, wife worked hard over 20 years to improve credit to just a couple points from perfect and BOA had raised limit to $24k.They just cancelled her account for inactivity with No warning letter, No email, No notice at all. Most companies give a warning letter to allow you make sure it doesnt get cancelled. Now this will affect her credit score she worked years to improve. Debt to income ratio. No help what so ever from customer service. I will be writing bad reviews on BOA often to make sure potential customers see how they penalize their responsible customers and maybe to get customers to drop BOA. Penalized for being responsible is ridiculous, we would have charged thousands to keep that active but no notice, no nothing...... just cancelled. Terrible job BOA, shame on you. I hope you lose many customers from all the reviews your about to receive from us. Don't use BOA. Go to Bank of Oz (great bank). Shame on you Bank of America!

(And as far as I knew, it shouldn't even have been possible, since I cancelled the card!). Now it's Friday night and their CLAIMS department ONLY WORKS ON REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS, so if you get hacked on a weekend, good luck, hackers can charge as much money as they want to your card until Monday when you can finally call BofA.

Overall this bank values what it can get from you not what it can work with you on. I have been with them for 10 years, they put my family through hell on a home loan, they then immediately sold the loan to another company. They promised to get the loan back and never did. Just recently we went to the bank and they ""upgraded our accounts"" told us how much better their CC was than our Capital one, told us we did not need the Capital one anymore. This cost us 160 points in our credit scores. They to apply for an auto loan to be denied, I asked the rep if i could just take a loan out against my savings account. Escalated the situation to corporate and the answer i received was this bank does not do loans, its all automated. Denied that they will do anything to make it right. Great bank if you just use normal banking, Have not had any luck outside of that. will be moving on to a local credit union."

No advance notification just an abrupt closure.  This certainly shows how little this organization values it's customers.

During these 6 months I have produced my passport and drivers license as proof of who I am but BOA seem to be incapable of fixing their mistake.  In a weird twist, they haven’t changed the name on my checking account so my ‘real’ name still exists there.

And every time we called to check on the status of being added to his account, we had to start from scratch. Nothing was ever recorded in the account, documents were saved in the wrong place. Lots of apologies, but no one ever actually got anything done. When we got to the point of making a payment, Bank of America did not credit the payment to the right place and we were sent to collections. When we tried to demonstrate that we had in fact made the payment, they started telling us again that we are not on the account.

The more ""customer service managers"" I talked to the more excuses and lies I received. First I did not have the right number, second that payoff amount was just an estimate or that I must have been caught in the billing cycle etc.  They would not under any circumstances remove this extra charge from my account.  I heard that they were sorry I was frustrated, and a plethora of other horrible platitudes.  I would highly recommend considering any other company but bank of America.

2020-06-08,Sara Rybacki,bsmith69001,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,"Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had with a credit card!! Or a company period for that matter! If I could give them a negative star rating, I would. I had autopay set up, as I do with all of my accounts, and it drafted the same, LARGE (over $3000) amount out of my checking account 3 separate occasions. This caused my checking account to be over drafted twice and causing me to incur over draft and line item return charges from my bank (not a Bank of America account). NO ONE was willing to help me resolve this issue that was 0% my or my banks fault. I was finally able to open a case with the dispute team, 2 months later, and after waiting a month for a response was finally told it was my fault that the autopay pulled the amount more than once. I have no idea how they came to that conclusion. I have an excellent credit score with upwards of 13 credit cards, all on autopay, and all paid off every month. I know how things work! I filed an appeal with even more evidence than I sent with the original claim and was told they refused to even review it. I have NEVER had worse customer service in my life. I will NEVER use Bank of America for anything again and plan to tell everyone I know to not use their products. They DO NOT give a hoot about their customers. Use Citi, Chase, or Capital One for your credit card and banking needs. They care. But whatever you do, DO NOT use Bank of America!"

I've got a credit card, a savings & checking account, and an auto loan with them.  I have never once bounced a check, and run well over six figures through this bank annually.  My credit score is excellent.  I know I am not a big player in the world of finance but I had hoped my loyalty and good standings would have afforded me some sort of respect or preferred status.  Apparently BofA simply believes the words 'customer services"" are simply a tag line for promotion only with no intent of achieving a level of success in providing service worthy of someone who chooses to bank with them.  My story is simple.  I deposited a check valued at over $10K into my checking account on 5/28 and was told ""my"" funds would not be available until 6/9, almost 2 weeks! When I called to complain I was told it was policy to hold larger check for longer periods. To complicate matters, I was heading to the hospital for surgery and was going to need the funds to pay my medical bills.  This story only gets worse with my visit to the branch and my visit with an caring Branch Manager and a useless Customer Service Manager.  In short, if BofA treats a 35 year customer this way, think about  what your experience will be after the lip service of how wonderful they are has passed.  You have choices, consider another financial institution."

When I paid the card off in full soon after, it just disappeared from my account and when I called they finally told me it had been closed and there was nothing they could do. They are not a bank for the people by any means. I've been in good standing with them for 11 years both in my checking account & credit card but have definitely had to dispute some random fees throughout the years, and more.

They basically disregarded the initial information that I gave them and sided with the vendor I filed against. Then to add insult to injury, I presented additional, detailed information, which proved the facts of my dispute, and Bank of America still supported the vendor. So I do not know what type of individuals they employ to handle disputes, but I feel that they do not truly value their customers. I experienced poor service/ frustration from the vendor, just to again be disappointed and frustrated by my bank. Thus, if I experience another unsupported claim with Bank of America, I will quickly terminate all services with them, and bank with an institution that fights for its customers."

I called them to try to see what happened and attempt to reopen the account. The Credit Manager Karen said in order to re-open it they would have to do re-run my credit.

I get a notification on my app I'm at a -888,888.00 balance. When I call the bank I'm told the bank did it for security risk so no one including me can touch the account. Turns out its frozen and due to be closed due to possible check fraud. Come to find out a favor I did for a so called friend turned out to be a bad check. It was never cashed it was returned and I got a 12.00 fee for returned check. I have been told so many lies by over 10 different employees i have spoken to since may 11th till today may 27th. My Bill's that are debited out of my account are gonna go through, that was a lie. Call in 3 days and will have an answer, that's was a lie. Request was put in to get my money sent to me that I have in my account, that was a lie. They say they make a note on my account everytime I call, that was a lie. It keeps going on and on. My Bill's are hounding me and late fees are adding up. When I ask I'm sure late fees will not be paid by bank of America cause they the ones that froze my account and that's the only truth I get is that they are not responsible for my late fees. I was also told it could take 3 months to resolve the issue. When I asked can anyone call the investigator on my case and they response was there isn't a number it's a group of analyst reviewing my account. So if there is an emergency for example a fire they dont have a phone to call 911 there are just gonna sit there. Bank of America is full of it. When I asked so being a customer since 1993 doesn't mean anything no credit or nothing, all I get is dead silence and then the same crap again that my account is being investigated. What would they do if it happened to them are they not going to go out of their way to resolve their issue or just sit back and listen to the different lies being told by the bank...."

Never do a balance transfer from BOA if you are a great client let the people who are irresponsible do the business with BOA so they will have bad loans and go out of business. I am predicting BOA will go out of business because of their lack of training for the staff. I hate this bank and will say to everyone I meet and make sure no one responsible goes through the anger I go through .

2020-04-28,kevpp27,kevpp27,False,Bank of America Business Services,1,"I have been a customer since 1992. The fees at BOA are higher than many other institutions, but we chose them as we assume they had all the systems and expertise we would even need. We submitted a Paycheck Protection Program loan application that sat in their queue for longer than the funding lasted, two and a half weeks. All of our information was correct but never made it to the SBA.  Later they confirmed that yes our application was fine, but sorry the SBA isn't accepting applications. If they couldn't process my application, they should not have accepted it. That is what many small banks are doing. BOA damaged the prospects of my firm and didn't represent us at all when it matter most. Any bank can service us when things are great. When things go wrong, that is when having a Bank work with you is most important. My recommendation is to find a smaller local bank where you can talk to the principles as need arises. At Bank of America, you can barely get time with their front line people in times of need, and you have zero chance of speaking to someone more senior. We will be closing our accounts with Bank of America once we get passed this mess. I would not be investing in BOA at this point as I know others feel similarly disappointed and disgusted with them."

It s not what the representative told me on the phone before. I noticed that I also registered '' my new bank account'' to receive the money from the IRS. I said that to the representative at the bank, he really didn't care. He just told me that I could open a new bank account with them and let me understood that otherwise, I could leave right away. As he was impolite and rude, I said no and I left. As a result, all my money was on hold during the pandemic, just when I lost my job. About 6 business days after, the check was not in my mailbox. I called BA, one more time, to talk to a supervisor. I explained to her all the situation, especially that I needed my money asap. She just said '' you have to wait it is our process''. The check will be sent back to us in case there was a problem with the post office. She didn't even say sorry neither tried to find any solutions. She was like a robot reading some lines.

The heat from the news forced them into opening up the loan without the credit card/loan requirement and I immediately applied.  I should have known that they did this in order to stop the bad press and but not to really process my application.   No matter what path I tried including waiting as much as 3 hours and 57 minutes for a live voice, I never heard one word back back from them by phone or email until the funding for this loan was used up.  The first and only email I received from Bank of America was to tell me that my loan application was complete....2 and 1/2 weeks after sending it....and that the SBS funding was no longer available.  In all of that time, they did not review my loan which was sitting there and it never got submitted to the SBA. They put my application on the back burner for sure and it was impossible to call them and entirely impossible to have anyone call you back or write you back.  Whether I eventually receive this PPP loan or not via the second funding of the SBA PPP program, I will remove every account I have had with this deceitful, disorganized, disgraceful bank."

I completed those documents & uploaded on 4/8/2020. A BofA representative called me a few days later informing me that they had received my application but was unable to give me any loan status updates, or to even verify that I had properly included &/or uploaded all required information. I'm an older technologically challenged computer skills. I know several business associates who have received their funding, all but 1 of them who applied on a later date than I, and ALL through smaller banking institutions that had REAL LIVE PEOPLE they were able to talk to. The greatest frustration is the inability to speak with ANYONE who can tell me anything except ,""be patient, you will be notified at a later date."" It sounds like the size of BofA & the number of requests overwhelmed them and their ability to process loan apps as quickly and efficiently as smaller lenders. I have been with BofA for 47 years, way before they were BofA, or Nations Bank, or C&S, or whoever they were before that. I've had issues over the years with them, but all overcomable, & I'm reluctant to change. Even though other institutions have spoken to me about why I should move over to them, I've stuck with BofA, mainly because of the number of branches they have to make it easier for my employees. Their  'non-personal' approach and lack of response to my many calls & emails for help CONCERNING THIS MATTER has left a very sour taste that will certainly result in switching to develop a banking relationship elsewhere after this mess is over, if not sooner. I'm open to recommendations."

I was asking for a HELOC for only 60% of the value on a home worth 1M that I don't owe anything on so they'd be in 1st position as a lender.  I own my cars, my boat and another home outright. This should be a slam dunk for them, right? I got all the info they requested in right away. I was supposed to get a call by Monday. I didn't. I called to follow up and they said it would be by Friday. They finally called on Saturday. The person said I need to supply a P&L statement. I explained that I sent them my 2019 return that was filed less than 30 days ago and according to their own guidelines, that should be sufficient. She insisted anyway. Fine. Then I log in to upload my dad-blame P&L statement they needed so desperately (less than one week after asking for it) and it says my application is no longer being processed and gives a # to call where you get a voice mail to leave a message. I haven't got an email, phone call or anything telling me this and wouldn't have known if I hadn't logged in. If I have this much trouble getting a loan, then I can't imagine they give out any of them. As Julia Roberts would say in Pretty Woman, ""Big mistake....HUGE!!!"" I have 700K in money market accounts at a different bank and they are happy to do a HELOC for me with no hassle. Geez. I will never give another second of my time to BOA. Now there is a ding on my flawless credit and they didn't bother to approve or deny my application...they've just stopped processing it because I took a week to get them a P&L statement from my accountant during tax season.

That means if you have a promotional rate DON'T USE YOUR CARD or you will be whacked with a finance charge!!!!  This card is being filed away and won't be used again until next year.

When I paid the full amount.A woman in the credit department said you have so many other credits can balance, I have to shout down your credit card or lower your interest. Then lower the credit limit by 80%.Are you kidding when you didn't shout down my credit card earlier? Ohh yes, Bank of America was enjoying my blood earning money high interest.I will never recommend Bank for America to anyone in a million years.  They are thugs. They put my running business in Jeopardy.Imagine, you are working hard to pay the dues, and regardless you have a normal life or not, Bank of America enjoy your interest and closed your account or lower the credit limit and destroy your business.Shame!!"

2020-03-15,robert_banis,robert_banis,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"In a nutshell, BofA has become very difficult to work with, non-customer focused and honestly does not exemplify the traditional meaning of a bank.  Here are just a few items that all add up to my complete dis-satisfaction:1.)	My family have never been charged for accounts, and now all our checking accounts are being assessed $122.)	As my kids were growing up, they saved coin.  We used to make it a learning experience to bring in their bags to the bank and deposit them into their savings accounts.  In the beginning, they brought in a bag or jar and branches would dispense in a machine and then deposit.  Years later you had to ask for paper rolls, roll it yourself and deposit.  Now you make it so difficult with rules your steer customers to grocery stores with machines that take 20-30% commission.  I think banks should manage and deal with money of all sorts in my humble opinion.3.)	My son went off to college this year, so we went into our local branch to cash in the savings bonds he had been given every year starting at birth from his grandparents for college.  To our dismay, the teller told us that he could only cash a maximum of 5.  Really????  These are government instruments!  We had to drive around Orange County to 4 different branches to get them cashed for his trip off to TX.  Absurd really.  Talk about not being customer friendly.  Not even the manager is empowered to make logical decisions.  I almost closed accounts on the spot.4.)	Stopped in the other day to pick up an extra check register, as they only sent a couple with my last check order.  Again – just another thing I could not accomplish while in the branch.  They don’t carry them anymore and told me I had to call customer service.  Well – that was even more of a frustration as your bank sends you to a 3rd party in India (it sounded like) and they wanted to charge me $2 per blank paper register!  It took 45 minutes to get through the right prompts, transfers etc. and actually talk to a person.  The prompts all kept wanting to order new checks – nothing for registers.  5.)	Your website and mobile app have no way of giving you your current balance.  What I mean is that if you pay using bill pay, it does not deduct it immediately from your balance until it processes which is usually at least a week out.  So – you have no easy way to know your “real” balance until everything clears – this the reason for check registers.  If I had to guess even though software change would make lives easier, BofA looks at bounced check charges as a revenue stream.  Why make it simple??6.)	I don’t write that many checks, but recently wrote one to a contractor and he went to my branch on the way home.  He had all the proper identification, yet they charged him $8.00 to cash my check, from my branch, at my bank!  I think this is ridiculous.  They even called me to verify which is fine, but still charged him.  I was not happy.There have been long periods where I have had $25k as my standing balance and sometimes much more.  Interest paid at your bank is embarrassing.  I took my recent company stock cash in of $150K and moved it from your institution to one that paid 2% for their premium savings account.  Your loss . I keep as little as possible because of the service your organization offers."

I asked them to increase the limit on my credit card . They increased it immediately. The only complaint I have is that the person who I think is Chinese at the Branch My Account is affiliated with has opened a futures account for me without asking . I settled that account later . But I found out later that closing accounts wasn't good for my credit score. That's why the person who worked there got a bad score on the person who opened the account to me without asking me.

So that was in my favor, but this was with my old account and they temporarily credited me $995 but I couldn’t use my account because it was locked and I was offered to open a new account for no fee. I am very disappointed and angry because they took out $995 in my new account and all I had was financial aid money so I feel like I was taken of my money and they could not put it back in. I am a college football athlete and student and 22 years old majoring in finance. I have seen a lot of reviews on BOA stealing money or being bad in customer service in terms of resolving issues and I can confirm this because I have had 2-3 other cases with this bank with fraud. So therefore, I do not recommend anyone banking with them because as a loyal customer of 4 years I do not feel like I have been helped in many ways. I am still learning and growing and regret not getting names and locations but they do not handle situations well at all or meet consumer needs."
2020-03-12,Justin Whyte,justinwhyte,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"BANK OF AMERICA CUSTOMERS BEWARE!A complete stranger walked into a Bank of America in Spartanburg, SC and emptied my bank account of a big chunk of change recently. The bank teller just handed it right over.Fake checks scams often entail using an out of state business check with a value between $1200 - $2000. Bank tellers should know this. This person deposited two of them into my account and withdrew $3000. Both checks were from small businesses in New York City. I feel like this might have been a red flag.What's even scarier is Bank of America's appalling lack of the use of ArtificiaI Intelligence and Machine Learning. A simple AI rule could have thrown up about 20 red flags. Let's see, I never go into banks. Ever. I never go to banks in Spartanburg, SC. I live in Baltimore. I never deposit checks in person. It's always through the mobile app. I never withdraw cash in large amounts. I have no reason to be in SC, depositing checks from NYC.Let me reiterate. If you bank with Bank of America, this could happen to you. They lack modern AI security controls and do not properly train their tellers."

I was devastated to know that a loyal customer for many years, could be left financially deserted, as I did not have any other credit cards or cash on hand. I was left with no way to pay for meals, transportation back to the airport or even the luggage airline fee to return home. The personal check that was deposited via mobile app was from my brother's acct as he confirmed that the funds has already been withdrawn from his bank.

The chip and pin card works well in Europe. The statements are clear, and it is easy to pay online. Just got an email reminding me that the special promotional rate for a balance transfer offer I used will be ending in 90 days. I appreciate the reminder, and I think that is a great way for BvA to prevent possible misunderstandings. In the past I've been an outspoken critic of BvA on several issues - guess I have to eat my words now. My AAA travel agent suggested this card, and I'm glad she did."

2020-02-14,Austin Barnes,albarnes09,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,"I was recently charged a $25 late fee for a $100 credit card payment. I paid the credit card amount on time, but the payment was returned because I switched bank accounts. (My fault!) When I tried to go online and change my account information, it said I was locked out of my account. I called a few days later to change my account information and during this process, I was penalized $25 for a late payment. (Not my fault, I was locked out!) It doesn't seem fair to charge someone a $25 late fee for a $100 payment, that was made on time. How can I make payments when I am locked out of my own account? I will be closing my credit card with Bank of America and taking my money elsewhere."

They called our home number when nobody was here and only gave 3 hour window to return the call. Customer service said send the other check and it will go through and will not be flagged. The 2nd check ended up being denied again a week later and once again they called our home # and only gave a 3 hour window to call back before denial. Fraud and customer service just kept transferring us back and forth and we had to explain the situation over and over again every time we were transferred. Finally gave up after the 4th transfer with no answers. Don't bother sending the 0% checks with the bills if you don't want people to use them. Also my wife is disabled and has severe speech issues so when she called she gave them her information and asked them to speak to me to make it easier since she is the cardholder and I cannot just call on her behalf. While most reps were ok with that the last one absolutely refused to speak to anyone other than my wife not caring that she gave her permission to allow me to speak for her while she was on the other line. Will never use B of A again. We are transferring our remaining balance to another card company and shredding this one. She had this card for years with another bank, but B of A bought them out a year or 2 ago and we have had nothing, but issues ever since."

Due to that I could not gain miles for a trip I purchased. Then, I did a balance transfer on my 2 credit cards and they assured me that the balance will be transferred within a 14 day time period.  Once I received the statement, it showed that the balance was not accurately transferred and that there was $0.79 shortage of funds that was supposedly late (over a $3k balance!) After calling customer service they were not helpful at all and said that I ""confirmed"" on a recording that the amount I transferred ($3k minus $0.79) was correct.  I asked to listen to the recording because I don't believe that it was correct, and they said that they cannot access the recording!  Not only did I have to pay a late fee, they also interest charge on the full amount because of their mistake!  All of this over $0.79!!!

2020-01-29,Janice Krasinski,jkrasinski,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"The BankAmericard credit card is amazing. It was my MVP a few years back, helping me pay off a pretty sizable balance from another card that was charging an arm and a leg in interest. The 0% period is longer than most (if not all) other balance transfer cards, the balance transfer fee is standard, and there’s no annual fee. So, I don’t really see why anyone would say they didn’t like this card. Either they’re off their rocker or they transferred their balance after the 60-day window to get a 0% rate. Or they didn’t pay on time and got stuck with the card’s high regular rate. Or their application got rejected because they didn’t have an excellent credit score. Ok, sure, there are ways your relationship with this BankAmericard could go sour, but it’s a lot less likely than with some other credit cards."

One day my ATM pin was not working so I went into the branch and gave my license and account information. The banker looked up my account, changed my pin, and everything was good to go. Never mentioned he needed to upload my drivers license. The following week I went to the drive up ATM, deposited $2,480. Drove back to work, signed into my account online and Zelle'd my landlord $1,000. About 20 minutes later I went to sign back into my account to finish my online bill pay and I was give a message to call 1-800 regarding my account. I call and I get transferred to Risk Closure, they inform me that my account was closed due to not uploading my drivers license to my account. I start panicking, so I call the Banker who helped me the week prior, he was not able to help. Every person I spoke with was rude and didn't care that they just took a single mothers entire pay check. They informed me that they would cut me a cashiers check and mail it to me, that was January 3rd and it is now January 18th and I still don't have my money.

They are the horrible bank to deal with. With decades old process and online system, I am not sure how they are surviving in today's world. Now I will explain the specific issue I faced. I had a checking account with them with a direct deposit setup. Along with this I have a credit card too. I used to pay my credit card bill online using my checking account. Few weeks back I closed my checking account for hell lot of issues like: 1. You cannot move funds quickly, 2. Their savings account APY is the lowest in the market. 3. Lots of restrictions moving money to and from. etc. The real problem started once I close the account and tried to pay my credit card. They dont have any option to pay credit card bill online using external bank account. What the heck!!!!! So, bill payment option started throwing all sort of weirdest errors and asked me to call a number every time. You will see a new number each time you encounter an error and funny part is none of them work. Now, I started trying make payment using their phone banking. Average wait time to reach a human is 40-50 minutes. And if you try automated payment system through phone, it will either not recognize your voice command or will not leave you any option to post the payment. You have to really really yell at it to make it understand the voice command. Bottomline. Weird, teared, worst online, phone banking and mobile banking compared to competitors. Out dated products and processes. Worst customer service I have ever seen in a bank. GO AWAY from BANK OF AMERICA!! And good luck if this bank survives for long with these systems and services."

2020-01-03,Juan-Pedro Garces-Voisenat,jpgarcesv,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"I started as a Fleet customer back in 2000. It was a great regional bank that was unfortunately absorbed by Bank of America. The level of customer service of BofA got increasingly more deficient with the years, to the point of being reduced to a minimal expression today. The waiting times in their mandatory transaction telephone lines are appalling. Some three years ago, when my checking account balance was more than 50K, due to my level of savings, they practically forced me to change to an interest-bearing account, arguing that I was ""losing money"". On average, they paid me a meagre interest of about 3 cents on 30K. They always addressed me opportunistically as their ""most valued customer"" (no wonder because they profited tremendously from my money balances). In recent months my money balances fell sharply to amounts well below 10K because I became unemployed. Instead of transferring me to my old non-interest-bearing account, they suddenly decided to start charging me a monthly service fee of 25 dollars. It is absolutely ludicrous! They have charged me in one month like 200 times more than all the accumulated interest they gave me. Outraged as I am, I have decided to close my bank account. But it was not enough to go personally to a branch to do the whole operation. They gave me one of their special numbers (which was constantly busy) to do another operation to close my credit card and travel card. I had to find another number online. I called and after waiting for half an hour on the line, the associate asked me how could he provide me an “excellent service”. I stated my purpose and he told me to “call tomorrow” because the people in charge had left for the day. This Texas operator told me that their time was only until 10pm Eastern time. After I hung up, I looked at my watch; it was 9:50pm Eastern time. Bank of America!"

2019-12-27,SAI JAY,saivetaus,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"I want to make you aware. Had a very bitter experience with  Bank of America. I presumed that my money in BofA is safe but unfortunately not. If you have cashed a check, the issuer  can reclaim the check as if it were a fraud and file a claim. The issuer can file a claim up until two years is what I was told by the BofA agent. Meaning issuer can re-cash the already cleared check anytime in the next two years.  BofA's claims department has the leverage of debiting that amount from your checking account without notifying you or at least they say they tired to reach you, which is false. My account has an email id, and they could have notified me via email. The bank has authorized the claims and XXX $ was debited from my checking account. Which ideally means, our accounts are an open book. I fought real hard, and all they have to say is I have to contact the issuer, and they will not help me. But they will take my money without my permission. How Convenient. What happen to their privacy and security. I strongly feel there are scammers inside this financial institution - Bank of America.I closed my BofA account and they immediately called my overseas number . Which means, they can call but they wont. They say this is how all the banks in the USA work. Never in my life I expected that I would have to deal with this shit"

After being on a call for over an Hour they stole my funds, after two representatives discussed the procedure and assured me that my account would receive a resolution. The worst part is I’m an educator who already makes little and for a multi-billion dollar corporation to lie and steal money from consumers is terrible. I spoke to an individual in the collection department and he assured me that once the claims department reopened my claim that when they gave me the final resolution if that entailed me paying any fees that I could make an arrangement with the overdraft collections department, but by the next day Bank of America went and stole my payroll funds from another account that is not linked to the account with the claim.

2019-11-29,Mitesh Shah,happy15551,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,1,"Bank of America's customer service and feature set have been absolutely appalling over the 8+ years that I have been with the bank. They have constantly changed account standings, settings, and issue fees even though my account was well above the threshold for these. This required me to have a monthly call with BoA to get them to refund the fees and each time I was told that it would not happen in the future but that it is the ""systems call"" whether or not changes and fees are issued; in other words, you will be charged a fee regardless of whether or not your account meets the minimum requirements for the fees to be waived. It seems that the ""system"" does this simply to be an inconvenience to you - each time I called the BoA customer service I have had to wait 15+ minutes on the phone and the callback feature does not work often either. I also have a Small Business Account with BoA; again, it more than meets the minimum requirements for all fees to be waived, yet each month I am charged a fee which I have to call to get reimbursed. I have made in-person meetings at my local branch, and while the agents have been very helpful, it seems that they don't entirely know how the BoA system works. This is surprising as they were unable to answer some of my basic questions, including why the system charges fees when the account is above the threshold. Overall, after 8+ years I have had enough of poor customer service where each agent says something different and seemingly no one understands how the system works and I have had enough of a broken system that charges its users fees regardless of whether or not they meet the threshold for the fees to be waived. Since I will be leaving BoA, I will be pulling my Small Business Account and have also had my partners and employees switch to the other bank where our Small Business Account moved to. Everyone seemed to have issues with Bank of America and were more than happy to move - this should tell you more than enough about the quality of service you will receive at Bank of America."

Useless Palm Desert CA branch provided me cumbersome conflicting requirements over time. Two meetings starred then-flunky Marina who subsequently was promoted to branch mgr position (replaced by new flunky minion Dan). BofA employee training specializes in flagging issues and obstacles. No problem solvers; just hand-wringing shufflers. Unbelievable that I was finally told my request could only be addressed by fam members simultaneously gathering in “convenient” out-of-state BofA offices (in different time zones no less) for mega-conference call to execute pucky BofA forms. Palm Desert morons stated requirement with straight face. Useless staff. Useless bank.

It started in February where $18,945.00 was taken fraudulently out of my checking account from multiple locations across the U.S and even in other countries. It totaled over 250+ transactions. Even when I called Bank of America customer service fraud department at the very same time we were on the phone and I was explaining the panic I was in and frustration of what I was seeing on my account there were still transactions being made. I have filed a police report with my local police department and Bank of America has closed my claim over three times. Every time they closed it they stated “the transaction were made with verification” . I am furious because the money came from a lawsuit of something very traumatic that happened to me. I trusted Bank of America with all of my funds and they guaranteed me that money is insured when it comes to fraud. Not only that but according to equifax my social security and all of my information was breached and that lead to the compromising of my bank account. Even after my first fraud claim with Bank of America I moved all my money into a separate private account with them and replaced my debit card and I STILL AM CONTINUING TO HAVE MONEY TAKEN FRAUDULENTLY OUT OF MY ACCOUNT! In may I was constantly having money taken out of my account from the PlayStation Network which I do not own anything affiliated with PlayStation. In August through September i have multiple transactions from PayPal taken off my account totaling over 2k+ . This is ridiculous I have had over 8 debit cards from Bank of America this entire year !

In their initial letter they said that my 800+ FICO score put me in the top 1% of applicants.  They later withdrew the approval because they ""couldn't verify my phone number"".  This is a cell phone I've had for approximately 20 years, one that I've used in every bank financial transaction/loan I've ever entered into.  BOA should be given credit for responding to the two rounds of letters I wrote to bank representatives, but they gave me no believable reason why a person would be refused such a small loan because of a phone number.  It should also be noted that I had a BOA Mastercard from 1994-2014 with a perfect payment record so they knew that I had a flawless credit history.

For example, my husband and I were booking a flight from Plattsburgh to Panama City.  On the chart, this is a Zone 3, for which I had enough miles for us to both go one way.  However, as this flight stops in Fort Lauderdale, it is considered a ""multi-city trip,"" in which you can't use your miles.  This should be blacked out on the chart so people realize that it's not even an option!  Plus, when booking separately (Plattsburgh to Fort Lauderdale and then Fort Lauderdale to Panama City), the miles used increases dramatically, as they are two different flights.

I informed the representative that I had no notice that they were not receiving payments.  We have had some medical issues in my family recently.

In June 2019 I called and spoke with Janet, the assistant VP of BOA who assured me that once I paid off the $1.50 (one dollar and fifty cents) I would be issued a check for the full $300 which would be mailed to my home address. After making sure she had the full address she assured me that within 7-21 business days I would have my money. Today is September 14th and I spoke with a representative on the phone because I STILL DO NOT HAVE MY $300.

In the end we incurred $150 in ""foreign exchange fees"". When we called to notify Bank of America and explain our position as new card users we were informed by the CSR that our situation was unfortunate and that they were unable to waive the fees as courtesy to the consumer and that they ""must set the precedence"" by holding firm to associated fees.

2019-09-02,catherine hiatt,chiatt23,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,4,"Overall I recommend it, but let me tell you my specific circumstance. I got the BOA secured card in late 2017 with the $300 deposit. I had really poor credit (low 500s) and had decided that I really needed to change my habits and start rebuilding. The way I looked at this card was a chance to rebuild NOT as a card with any perks. I hadn’t earned that right. I knew I didn’t want one of those “bad credit” cards where they approve you for $300, but your initial available credit was like $175!!After a year of responsible use and on time payments, I called customer service to ask about limit increases. Here is what I was told, and this seems to be different than what I’m reading from others. I should note that I’m also a BOA banking customer, I’m not sure if criteria differs based on that fact. Anyway, I was told I can make deposits (in $100 increments) and that was the only way to increase my limit on a secured card. Also that I couldn’t request graduation to an unsecured card but that it would be periodically evaluated. I will say they were very unclear when these evaluations take place. Earlier this year I decided to start making deposits to increase my available credit, while also keeping my usage low. I increased the limit to $700.Within 6months of making those deposits, they were returned (all $700) to my checking acct and my limit was increased to $1700. I had finally been graduated to an unsecured card after almost 2 years (yes, I called them to confirm this). This has been a slow process but that was a rewarding moment. I’m going to wait a little longer and then apply for a card for above average creditMy only question is, if I had started making those additional deposits a long time ago would my card have been graduated sooner? Could just be coincidence though. My FICO score was 662 when the graduation took place, and I have had ZERO late payments on anything in the last 2 years, since they look at all of your credit report when making this decision NOT just your Americard usage."

I had stopped at a branch and reviewed some transactions, seeing Beijing China had started making one small charge and one large charge periodically on my statements. Over three months they stole around 750$. This occurred after I gave my debit card information to a company called Chimp Basket, for a hair curler that I never received. I had seen the ad for it on Facebook. The charges were at first credited by BOA and then reversed, making me the victim of fraud. Their reason was because I didn’t catch the charges quickly enough and the company didn’t drain the account completely- so I was basically penalized for them not stealing more money from me. I guess they thought they’d stay under the radar the way they were doing it, and it worked for a while until I caught it. Apparently I didn’t catch it quickly enough. The Bank of America staff blamed me and made me feel helpless- for someone in Beijing making unauthorized charges. Abominable."

Suddenly your 20 000 miles become $20. No foreign currency transaction fees which is a plus for travelers. However BofA is a joke when you encounter a problem with a card in anywhere outside US, it is impossible to get customer service on the phone. Also Zone 2 boarding is a lie; i flew around 8 times since getting that card never got Zone 2, usually 3 or 4.By comparison I also have a 1.5% cashback card that has a set ratio and the tangible cash benefit is usually around $2000 actual dollars not some fiction miles."

The last thing three kids were are trying to adopt needed was another disappointment in their lives. Thanks to the kind lady that provided housing, we didn't have to disappoint them. But, Alaska Airlines or BofA, there is NO excuse for this. I'm not sure whose fault it is. BofA is blaming Alaska. Never once did I get a text, an email, or any other warning or notice that the card was, in effect, canceled. I asked that they pay the difference between motel costs....the next cheapest was over $180/nite. They refused, stating they don't do any compensation.

We got disconnected and they didn't have the decency to call me back to finish updating my daughters profile to be able to have students status  ( Students status that they had for the past 5 years). They said they wanted to update their date of birth, like it's something that changes. It is a shame.

Back to the bank the next day to sign the contract & the rep Cheryl tells me, OOPS! I pre-qualified you for to much of a mortgage. WHAT!!! So not only did we not get the house, We lost our $500.00 we spent on the home inspection!! She looks at us & says sorry about that, my mistake.

I made the deposit on Friday and was told as long as I did so before 9pm it would be available the following day. I was first told it would be available on Saturday. On Saturday they said Monday at 9am. I called on Monday and was first told Tuesday then they said the system was unable to read the check so I would need to go into a branch. I get to the branch and they tell me to call customer service and have them cancel the check so that they can just cash it. I called and customer service tells me that I have to wait until Friday which makes a week.

Spoke with Account Rep  Santrese Cassidy. After a long convo she did not offer any help .I explained I am trying to make a good faith payoff to avoid collections and settle the debt. No help was offered  at all . No interest deduction no payment plans etc. They said I do not qualify even with an excellent payment record.Other credit card companies have worked with me since this hardship to keep our credit good and offered a pay off Which we paid and made good . We pretty much got the its not our problem reaction. Pretty frustrating and unbelievable .I will continue to pay the minimums i guess.This company is huge and i'm sure the accounts are secured.

BUT I pay my Citi card the same Tuesday via phone and Wednesday my bill is paid.  ALSO, they will report to credit bureau before you pay, so it always looks like you carry a balance, 5 days  before, every month.  Glad to rebuild my credit, but pass and do CITI."

They do not deserve even one star.  HORRIBLE customer service and sloppy bookkeeping!  I originally had Greenpoint.  When they went down and B of A took over, the horrors began, starting with forced placed flood insurance even though I had proof via a flood survey that I was not in any dangers of flooding.  They added $1500 a year into my motgage and increased my payments for 3 years.  Even though I fought them and continued to dispute what they were doing, they stated they wanted a new more detailed survey (cost to me out of pocket in the amount of $3000).  I finally had to get the new survey, which of course totally cleared my property of any flood danger.  They then stopped the forced placed flood insurance, but gave me a continual run around about refunding the $4500 they unlawfully extorted from me and would not refund it.  B of A also charged many unlawful ""fees"" and ""late charges"" they refused to refund.  As long as the government keeps protecting these bank criminals, they will continue to defraud people!

I was late on a payment and had made it through my app, I didn’t see it showing up and called to fix the issue - knowing I had made a mistake (first time in the 18 months I had the card was I late), they wouldn’t waive my late fee or interest, which was fine. They took the money out of my account (~$1,100), but the associate didn’t realize it was already coming out from the payment I had made through the app which hadn’t been showing, I was out ~$2,200 at this point. They tried to refund it twice with no luck saying that my account was “past due,” even when a manager had supposedly had it expedited for two business days and I had definitely paid off the full balance on my account with the $1,100 (really $2,200). I was supposed to receive my money on Monday and it was not in my account, now I should be receiving it tomorrow. Bank of America has been holding my money for 2 weeks, they owe me ~$1,100 and still haven’t refunded it appropriately, in my opinion they’re crooks and their customer service department doesn’t care in the least."

I did not see the e-mail notification of my bill of $92.00 last 2 months, if I got them at all and in consequence had a late fee of applied, which was a minor problem. As soon as I found out I missed a payment, I immediately called and explained missing their emails and informed them that my credit union would send the money immediately electronically. It would have been good customer relations to waive the fee, but they refused to do so. The main problem with BoA was after I pad and they received the money, I received a letter from BoA stating that my credit limit (built up over years) had been reduced to $500 from $57,500. If I wanted a store charge card, I would have gotten one and it would have been much more that $500. I called to ask how the decision was made, Tonya was no help and I asked for a manager. After waiting on hold for about 20 minutes, I hung up and will not ever speak to anyone there again. Absolutely the worst customer service imaginable, how anyone uses BoA is beyond me. Save some aggravation and go to other cards, Am Exp or Citi, much better customer service.  So be warned: years of loyalty are worth less to B of A than $92.00 (charged for a bill of that amount that was overdue by about 32 days)."

They make it look so easy and it might seem fair price for your clover device but believe me they are ripping people off. They will sign you up for a long term contract and you won't be able to get out of it for a long long time. I closed my store last year and I called BOA Merchant customer service to close my account immediately after I shut down my business. They were unable to cancel my account unless I pay over $500 cancellation fee so now I'm stuck to monthly fees until next year. They should be more supportive of small business as we are the ones who work hard to make the magic happen ... but instead they will lure you in and if your business doesn't go according to your plan you will be stuck with long term fees. There are many other companies out there to chose from .... This is my experience and I would like to share with everyone. Please don't make the same mistake I did.

Again, this is a restaurant in my neighborhood near my house and I eat there regularly.This was embarrassing and irritating. This happened in front of my family and friends with whom we were dining. To make it worse I am friends with the owners, as are my in-laws, and my kids went to school with the owner's kids. Even though you know someone you always wonder what is going on with someone who has his credit card use denied...This is the third time that this has happened.

Not a single ticket in first class can be booked if you want to upgrade. And for one flight I was trying to upgrade on, not a single ticket was booked, and they still wouldn't let me upgrade. And any money in your Alaska wallet to use for future use can't be used either. They just take your money and then treat you like you're asking for the moon if you want to use your money for anything than what you originally booked.

So when I see a mysterious late payment show on my credit report I was in complete shock. I have never, ever made a late payment to any card! When I call to figure out what happened the rep apologized and said he would get it resolved. He didn’t know why they didn’t notify me that auto pay had expired but you have to re enroll every year? First time I’ve ever heard of that but ok. He said he would submit a request to have it removed from my report. Someone would call me within the month to update me. I never received a call so I call back. Had to re-explain everything. This representative said that they were missing information on the request and filed it out with me again for a courtesy adjustment on my credit report. Was told someone would reach out to me again within the next two weeks with resolution. Again never received a call. Called back in today and had to wait on hold all over. Re-explain everything all over again. The representative had no idea what I was talking about. Customer service was absolutely poor. She told me I had to dispute with credit bureaus not them and they don’t do adjustments or something along those lines. I wasn’t disputing. I was looking to a  courtesy adjustment because I was never notified and she just didnt seem to care. Canceled my card immediately after. Will never do business with BOA.

We deposited our checks and they are holding a bank check till August 1st when they said we could haev cashed it and had the funds right away vs waiting for the deposit to clear. This was the last straw so we are leaving the bank with our familes...Bank of america lost a lot of money and we have had nothing but troubles with them not keeping track of accounts. We have had several incidents where Money was overdrafted due to processing then fixed and having to fight them for their automated crap. Due to them not giving money on direct deposits from Amazon for a day or so we would wind up missing bills. They would tell us we could do nothing but wait for them to resolve disputed charges where some reason it was rang up twice for food. We would pay a 5 dollar safe checking fee on my account not my husbands to never have to worry about overdrafts and they would still do overdrafts.  We called on multiple days, sat with several physical Tellers, managers, and supervisors, and even made them get on a three way merge call with my grandmother's bank for the current check having issues through them which is one of those checks you have to buy with money and is considered cash. It is very dissatisfying that our honeymoon was cut short due to the bank being unjust and not resolving or being able to verify over the phone when they had all these simple solutions they should have been able to do without their clunky software and locks. We did talk to several other banks who said that they can do that since each bank has its own policies but most banks would have had the money resolved since its been technically 4 days now. Due to all these issues we decided to pull our money and go to an alternative bank. Our families are doing the same which means they lost way more money then they anticipated.On a positive note the application process is not bad and I didn't have much issues when i got my gender change with them changing the info and changing account types. They do try to keep you safe and lock accounts for activity that feels different from what they usually see but its all mostly automated. Sucks when you need to wait an hour for it to unlock again due to the fact that it autolocked from buying from a different store, site, or in a different state than it is usually active. Other than that and easy access to an overly placed atm everywhere from being such a huge company It really feels not worth it."

First, branches are closing everywhere and the low amount of locations gets lower and lower everyday.   Before these branches started dropping off the map, the line at Bank of America was out the door every time I went.  Now, it's like your waiting on a ride at the amusement park.   The customer service has suffered big time.  I just called and waited over an hour to talk to a rep.  Next, they are open till 5pm ONLY with a mandatory 1 hr wait.   So if you work 9 to 5, you get just 2 hours on Saturday to do your banking.  Yes, you guessed it.  The wait is just as bad on Saturday. Clearly the worst hours of any of the financial institutions.  Now they have the fewest and farthest between when it comes to amount of locations.  They clearly are taking advantage of customers and closing locations to recoup losses.   The problem today was: they hit me wth 8 overdraft fees for declining a transaction 8 times.  My account is negative a lesser amount than the 8 overdraft fees added up!  After waiting an hour and speaking to a supervisor, they said they could only refund 1 of the fees.   I hope I can save others from going through this thievery by sharng my experience."

I found dealing with their claims department to be an insulting experience because of utter stupidity of their staff, including supervisors. And so, after a quarter of a century of being a loyal member  I canceled this card.

I decided today to construct a list of all my credit cards and their purchase and cash advance rates. This would be useful in helping determine which card to pay off first and which card to use for future purchases. Other factors also apply of course (namely total cash back and cash back percentage).Of my 11 credit cards, I was able to find the purchase APR and cash advance APR quickly by perusing their websites (except for Amex. They made it difficult to get the percentage rates. It took me a few minutes longer. Amex had the highest purchase APR bar none! No wonder they gave me the run around).With Bank of America, the website told me to submit a request and they'll back to me via email or snail mail and stated that it might take them 3 to 5 business days to get this info to me. I was forced to navigate the labyrinth of their phone menus before finally getting a live person who gave me the rates.As it turned out, this card had the second lowest rate amongst my 11 credit cards. And they were trying to hide this from their customers? When combined with good cash back rates for gas & groceries, this makes this card number one in those categories.

She’d just passed the 5/24 rule and her inquiries dropped to 2, so thought it’d be a piece of cake, but …First, some info:  Her credit rating is 813.  We own two houses outright, and our net worth is $1 million plus.  We have no debt, and have been banking with BOA for years.  My wife also earns $50,000 a year, and teaches for a school district.So, you’d think all would be easy, right?  Filled out the online application, and BOOM – “Congrats, you’ve been approved”  - great, BUT – as I looked closer, approval was only for $1,000.  Hmmm, so I started reading the fine print following the notice.Ready?  It said any approval with less than a $5,000 limit WOULD NOT receive the ‘Signature’ card.  Rather, they would be sending the ‘Platinum Plus’ card instead.  No bonuses offered under the ‘Signature’ card would be honored.  SO, classic ‘BAIT AND SWITCH’ by BOA. I’ve called to get the issue resolved, but as of yet BOA’s only answer was:  We can’t disapprove without issuing a lower card ….  Or something like that.  Meanwhile, I’ll just need to cancel the card if I’m not satisfied.  Oh, and the inquiry is now logged, and my wife’s credit was knocked slightly.  It’s more the principle of the whole thing."

I think Credit Unions are the best option at this point."

Bank of America fraudulently approved this form illegally without reading the trust documents. In order to fix this issue, I have had 5 separate phone calls, 1-3 hours each. All they have to do is add my name to an  account (I've provided 100 pages of trust documents, SSNs, death certificates, etc.) I've driven to their office 4 times and followed every single instruction they gave to the T. (Many times they provided us contradictory instructions - something different with every phone call.) Even after all this I am no closer than when I started and I have to get lawyers involved to access my own money. I am unable to access over $100,000 because of Bank of America's fraudulent actions!

I am cancelling my card as I write this review. I have had the card for 4 years and saved my points only to have nothing resembling a benefit.

2018-02-11,Garry Dom,gdomin0000,False,Bank of America Mortgages,1,"I don't write reviews, but I've decided to let out my frustrations based on a bad deal with Bank of America. First of all, that name does not represent America (it should be changed) because it forces people to take bad loans in efforts to profit the institution. I am stuck with a balloon second mortgage loan, which was never discussed at closing. As I am getting close to the term of the agreement, a letter was sent by the bank and the word balloon came up in big bold letters. When I called to get a clarification of what the ""balloon"" stands for; I was told that it is an interest only type of mortgage. My understanding was at the end of the term of the mortgage, I would be finished paying for the loan. This was a $69,000 loan and 13 years later, I still owe $55,000. Two more years to go to complete the term in which I taught to have a ZERO balance. Lesson learned, some banks cannot be trusted as they are greedy and will take advantages when possible. The government has now established regulations to punish banks that continue such practices.Be alert with mortgage transactions with Bank of America and those alike. Please read the agreement carefully and ask questions. If you feel something is wrong, go with another bank. Usually smaller banks offer better terms, and they are not as aggressive and greedy for your hard earned money.-Garry"

Very exciting.I waited until Dec 26th to start checking my account hoping that the companion fare was added each day. I finally contacted Alaska airlines to find out when to expect the companion fare, so I could plan accordingly for booking our trip.I was told that I would receive the companion fare after my credit card statement closing in the middle of January.This delay and issuing of the companion fare by Alaska Airlines has affected pricing for our trip and therefore the dates we will be able to take our trip and we no longer will have the ability to use, the then expired, free 1st class upgrades.We all have relationships in this world, weather with our significant others, the businesses we deal with or if we are a business, our customers.Usually if you're giving a gift for your anniversary, three weeks after your actual anniversary, things don't go very well. Each of us decides how important the relationship is and how important that anniversary is.It is apparent by their actions that Alaska Airline doesn't put too much importance on the relationship with their credit card customers and their anniversary date.I just think other consumers need to be aware of where you stand with Alaska airlines before signing up for their credit card."

This year, I needed them to back me on a fraudulent $500 Platinum credit card charge / rip-off scam from a local vendor to repair my broken A/C unit. Naturally, I immediately found someone else to finish the A/C work and learned just how dishonest the first vendor was. When I disputed the charge, BoA took their time in reaching out to me and then made me fill out 10pages of information and asked for unreasonable documentation that was impossible to acquire due to the length of time (over a week) passed by then. They wanted a second opinion, on letterhead (not an invoice) detailing the problem and what the original vendor did wrong.  A.) The problem had been repaired by then you bureaucratic morons!  B.) The second vendor wanted nothing to do with a formal statement on fancy letterhead - that he didn’t even have! In its place, I presented the second invoice AND a notarized affidavit based on the suggestion of the BoA rep. It took them TWO MONTHS to make a decision on the charge and ruled in favor of the vendor - based on semantics in my statement and lack of letterhead.I AM DONE! Will take ALL my accounts and go elsewhere."

2017-09-28,en142798,en142798,True,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,"This card is terrible. When I first got the card, it was secured and through the bank account I had with them. I put $300 down to secure the line of credit and was told that if I used it and made all of the payments on time and had a zero balance at the year mark, they would graduate it for me and turn it into an unsecured card and I'd get my deposit back. That was in 2013. I applied every year and finally at the beginning of this year, I got my graduation. I have had good credit for the last two of those years. I've never missed a payment and I haven't carried a balance on this card since right before the year mark, so 2014. Every time I've used it since, I have paid it off immediately. When they graduated me, I was approved for a $500 limit and a $39 annual fee, and this card has never had any rewards. I haven't been able to get an increase to save my life and they won't lower the interest rate or remove the fee. I called to ask and they said it was because I have serious delinquencies on my credit. I have two very old accounts in collections that are about to fall off that have not affected my ability to grow my credit score to a beautiful 700+, pick up the American Express every day blue cash card (no annual fee), Chase Sapphire with an $11,000 limit, or the ever difficult to obtain CapitalOne VentureOne card (also with no annual fee) and a $5,000 limit. Clearly I can handle my credit, but I don't know what Bank of America is doing. When I asked them to close my account, they happily said okay. This is funny because just 20 minutes prior, I requested to close my CreditOne card. I feel I have outgrown this card. They fought so hard to keep me with an annual fee refund and the possibility that I'll be able to wipe out some of the features of this card I don't like. More on that in February when I call in and request it, but, I found it a touch disheartening that the Bank of America people didn't even try to keep my business and the really kind of horrible CreditOne people did (the card is horrible, not the people). So, there is my review... take it for what it is worth. Don't be surprised if you kinda get treated like the scum of the Earth even after you've built your credit into the skies. Closing a card never felt so good."

When I brought my house last year, I charged all my new house expenses (washer, dryer, wood flooring, landscaping, window treatment...) on this card. With all the reward I saved up. It's perfect for a new TV. When I'm ready for TV shopping, I'd got a letter from them and stated my Visa account are being closed due to all the unusual activity with my account and they consider I'm a risk to the bank. And the very worst thing was all cash reward were gone, ""forfeited"" is the term. I call and spoke to every single soul at the customer service, supervisor, and managerment. I explain the situation to them and offer pay the entire balance at once. Unfortunately, According to them nothing they can do once account are closed, so is all the cash reward. I question them why wouldnt they contact me first or at least give me a chance to explain what's going on? All I got from them was they were sorry. I paid of the Visa card the very next statement and closed all my account with them. This is a true story and thats how BoA treat a loyal customer."

2016-06-16,Gina Hall,gina_hall,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,4,"Caveat:  I do not work for Spirit Airlines and agree that their customer service at times is not the best.  Nevertheless...If Spirit actually flies to your desired destinations, then you just need to understand how to utilize the rules to your benefit.First of all, if you are husband and wife (or any travel pair), you can get 35K bonus miles (which is 15K for person #1, 15K for person #2 and 5K for person #1 referring person #2).Detroit - Cancun roundtrip offpeak is 5,000 miles per person whereas a typical ticket is $300 - $400 per person.  Do the math and decide when to pay in miles and when to pay in cash.Secondly, your miles have the most value when you use them off-peak.  Look at the off-peak schedule and travel only during that time (if possible). You can also get partial savings.  We booked a one-way to Punta Cana on a particular day using miles and a return flight on another airline using cash and the net cost is less than a roundtrip ticket using cash.  Again, do the math!Thirdly, be mindful of the rules.  Use your card at least once a month, if only for a $5 purchase at McDonalds.There is no downside to the card.  There may be downside to Spirit Airlines in terms of customer service (sometimes) and charges for everything they deem extra - which is everything.  Factor this into your travel costs and decide if another airline has a better deal (either financially or ""emotionally"")."

I don't think some people understand what ""off-peak"" seasons mean.
They try to book for summer flights and holiday weekends and wonder why they cant find flights for 2,500 miles. (insert pic of WTF-girl-meme here.)
Also, book more than 6 months in advance, and you don't have to pay any redemption fee, people!"
2016-06-09,Jeanne Palomino,jeannep3,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,2,"Bear in mind, you can have many points for regular purchases but can only use the Travel Rewards points on BoA if you used some of the purchaes on travel. (Eg, if you have 50,000 points, you have to have spent at least $500 dollars- on travel expenses (anything from bus and plane tickets or hotels, to cabs or to buy or refill metro / subway / public transportation fares.) If you have 50K points but only spent 100 of your card purchases on travel, you can only use 10K of your points for travel reimbursement. Also, this card only REIMBURSES travel- and that can be a pain. (See reviews by others below. Travel charges on the card, which are 'covered by points'- you end up paying interest on the charges during the delay period before BoA gets around to reimbursing you for your travel purchase. Big costly whammy there!)  Also BoA I haven't tried this yet-  but I have another BoA card- regular ""BoA Rewards'. My travel rewards card only REIMBURSES for travel services- and I hear there are costly  problems with that. (See reviews below from others.)  The regular 'Rewards' card has 'concierge travel service'- where you pay for the travel WITH your points directly. A customer service rep told me I could accumulate 1.5 points per purchase on my BoA Travel Rewards card (the 'regular' rewards card only gives 1 point per dollar charged, so that's not cost-effective) but that I could then TRANSFER the accumulated Travel Reward Card point over to the Regular Rewards card, (with no loss of points) and use my regular BoA rewards card to book travel through the BoA (regular) Rewards card Concierge Desk- and that way the points on the old card's Concierge desk- will pay for the travel costs directly with the accumulated points- no waiting and paying interest on reimbursements. It might not work- it was a suggestion from a rep, I haven't tried it yet. OR it could be that the prices are higher on the Concierge Desk than booking directly- or that might not be the case but - transferring the 1.5 points accumulation on the Travel Rewards BoA card to a regular BoA rewards card might be a solution to all the costly problems people have using the Travel Rewards points or getting them reimbursed."

I never had any problems when they were with VISA, but on my first billing I got an ""Interest Charge on Purchases"", I called member services and asked how that can be because I have auto-payment where my bill is paid in full every month. She said it was an error in the system and happened because it was the first billing system with the new ""Master Card"" charge card. She said it would be reversed, BUT if it happened to me, then I suspect it happened to many others. Not everyone scrutinizes their charges and there will be many that just pay the charge and not take the trouble of rectifying it.This should have been a safeguard in the system, and if this can happen with something like this, it makes me wonder, just how well they are watching out for us (their customers)."

2016-05-03,Sia Salmen Vom Dorp,sias1,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,"Be aware that BOA has changed their policy regarding how travel reward points are redeemed. The new way they are actually earning interest!we have been BOA customers since 1998 and in the past these travel rewards points simply were exchanged for a ticket. The new BOA policy stipulates that the customer first pay upfront for the ticket with the same credit card that has earned them the travel rewards points. This way the customer actually pay for their trip upfront. Secondly the money is supposedly refunded the following business day as their travel reward points are redeemed. This is where the system fails and actually becomes fraudulent!Personally this is our experience: Three months later and many hours spent on the phone, we still had not been reimbursed for the ticket we paid for upfront. in addition, BOA also charged us interest for the trip and it was substantial due to the ticket cost.We had repeatedly called the supervisor at BOA travel reward department who had promised to promptly reimburse us for the ticket we bought with the thousands of travel rewards mileage we had accrued. Three months later, when nothing happened, she stopped taking our phone calls!Yesterday an employee in the business card department found our travel miles unredeemed in our account.  That day only we had spent four hours on the phone being transferred back and forth between departments or just plainly hung up on! The supervisor at the travel rewards department had not even bothered to follow up on our claim. Shame on you BOA Travel Rewards Department!

They always came up with hundreds of reasons for not being able to cancel my account (like charges suddenly appeared at the same exact time in the middle of the month when I wanted to cancel my account). Guys working there are really racists and sketchy. They are so afraid to introduce themselves by their last names. I talked to this George guy who refused to tell me his last name while he repeatedly told me that he has my last name differently on-file. Made me sound like I don't know the root of my family. Every time, I called these people, they were more concerned about asking my mailing address precisely down to the zip code (which I am pretty sure they could look it up if they have a brain or some sense of being a human) to deliver a piece of useless confirmation (which I am very sure that they could deliver by email). Overall, they are genuinely more concerned about where I live and my ethnicity rather than offering me some professional help.

It does give you something for spending on their card. I would improve the rate of the cash reward though. 1% is OK but 2% or even 3% would be a lot better.

The second time I called, they said that the person I talked to didn't know what they were talking about, and offered to send an inquiry to the cash rewards department. Two days later, I got the email confirming that I had earned the $100 cash back. Only problem was, they applied it to the end of February. So my cash rewards account said that I had been paid $113.98 at the end of February, but my debit card balance only reflected $13.98--missing the $100. This is the third time I've called, and been transferred to four separate departments half of them not knowing what I was talking about and some not even knowing that there were more deals associated with a cash rewards card.

HOWEVER, I recently traveled out of the country and notified BOA of my travel dates to safeguard against any fraudulent charges on my account out side of that window of time. Two weeks after the date I notified the bank of my return, there were almost $2000 of fraudulent charges on my account. I still have the card in my possession! Someone must have somehow duplicated my card. BOA does not monitor this card!! They never froze the account nor notified me of the charges. When I filed the fraudulent claim, they investigated and denied the claim. They said the card and a signature was present. Well I don't know how the card was duplicated because I still have that card in my possession,  but the signature would have been easy to obtain if they looked at a receipt I signed while there. Make sure you monitor your transactions carefully. Since they denied the claim despite the travel notification that I provided, I will be using another card and will be happy to pay the annual fee if they can provide security."

I use mine to purchase things that I normally would have to purchase anyway, but by using the card, they give me credit that I can use to pay down my card or have it deposited into my checking account. I think it's an awesome benefit. My only gripe is that they lower the cash back amount to 1% after a certain amount. Their customer service is very good.

On the downside, there's no rewards, and my credit limit is never getting extended on the card (which is the same as the deposit).

Yes, $132. Which was very shocking to me. When I spoke to customer care (Tim), He told me that the value of 1.5 point is only $1 and some extra charges for cash redemption. It is same for gift cards too. They say 4200 points for $25 gift card. This is pathetic. If anyway, I am going to get less than $1 for each $100 spent then Why are you cheating customers saying you are earning more points. Till now, BoA impression was very good for me but it is lost.

I like that I get 1.5x points for all purchases, but I do wish there were certain categories I could get more in. Since I have that for my Freedom though, it didn't bother me too much. I would recommend it only to people who travel, since there are better cash back cards out there, with similar bonuses. Oh! I like the 20,000 point bonus for spending $1000 in the first 3 months.

I was disappointed in the rewards though. Although I used the card frequently, it felt like I was barely earning anything extra. I could have gone with a secured card with no rewards and have pretty much the same experience. The interest rate also was higher for this card than some of the others I have, which is probably why it's so easy to attain.

In addition to an annual fee, the points are valued at approximately $.005.

By the way, after you redeem points for tickets, you still need to pay around $100.00 in taxes and fees per ticket.You are way better off with Chase Ultimate Rewards, Capital One Venture, Amex, Barclays, or pretty much any other rewards card provider.The only reason that I even signed up for this card is because the flight attendant on the flight blatantly lied about points value.  She presented it as though I could get a round trip flight after spending around $2500.00.Also, the airline charges fees for anything and everything.

ALL Web based, etc.  Works for me!  Right?  Sort of.  BoA has bad reviews all over for the fees they charge, but I ignored them thinking they can't be THAT bad.  I admit, I never kept a large balance, if ANY balance in this account, because I simply use my CC for all purchases to get points for travel. Only on the occasion do I use this account for groceries, eating out, etc.  Nevertheless, I paid BoA so many ""overdraft fees"" that were suspicious to say the least.  For example.  I was in Dallas on business, and the night before I came back I saw the low balance of about $59 left in the account, with only 1 bill Pending at the time.  I knew I had a check floating out there, so I decided to withdraw funds from my savings, and deposit it the following morning at 7 am.  Mind you, I checked the account the previous night while in bed after 10 pm.  I went to deposit, and lo and behold, that check written over a month ago was miraculously charged through.  NOT PENDING, but cleared entirely.  This over drafted my account, and the money I deposited brought it back up to a single dollar.  I called and notified them of this, and they stood by their charge of $35 on the account.  Sure, I know this is ultimately my fault, however, the timing of things is what is questionable.  This is not the only time this happened.  I've had several overdrafts because of EXACTLY this same thing.  A check is written, and never seems to go through, UNTIL the available balance seems to be lower than what it can cover.  Resulting in an overdraft fee.  Each time, I have deposited funds to more than cover it, when it was never shown in the account to begin with, but suddenly it clears with no processing time, or nothing.  I find that odd, how some checks will process for 2 sometimes 3 days, but only when there are funds to cover it, but when there aren't sufficient funds, they process right away, and are posted as if they were ran through before any other charges were completed.  BoA is killing customers with fees, and it is a shame because most would think I can't balance a check book, but the fact remains, I have enough in my savings accounts to live comfortably.  I just don't use BoA for that money because their rates are bad, and they aren't anything more than a pay for pizza bank, and in my book, never will be.Save your money, go with a local credit union, and enjoy higher returns on savings.

We're getting 3% back on gas, and that is one commodity that we tend to go through quickly.  Every time we accumulate $25 in rewards, it pays out cash.  We tend to take that and tuck it back in, using it to pay on our balance.We do keep a budget and we stay on that, paying off the balance in full each month.  Getting that extra cash back is a perk I'd never give up!"

I like using this card's reward system--pays out fast and is easy to use. Get a lot of rewards for just doing the things you would usually be doing/paying for. The interest rate is 0 for the first year, and then is about 11-22% for the years afterwards. I know it's a bit high, but it's worth it and a good rate in comparison to some other cards. Over all, I would recommend this card to others that are interested in setting up a credit account. One of my favorites."

I signed up because I was short on cash and didn't have a return ticket back home yet. When I later called to see if I can redeem the miles, I found out that my miles would become available after the first purchase. Well ok, that's reasonable. So, when my card came in I made a purchase on it and called them back again to redeem my miles. THEIR STORY CHANGED A SECOND TIME! Now all of a sudden I find out that my miles wouldn't be available until after my first billing cycle. Wtf, I have to go home. I thought whatever, I'm going to be flying again soon anyway, I can use my miles at that point. Well now it's been a month and a half later, I'm trying to use my miles (which should be 15,150 by now) and it shows that I have 0 miles in my account! When I call them THEY CHANGE THEIR STORY A THIRD TIME! Now all of a sudden they want me to wait until after the second billing cycle.

2015-10-23,rachelo1,rachelo1,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,4,"I opened a Bank of America checking account in high school, and was able to maintain the same account throughout college with no monthly fees. When I graduated college, Bank of America made me switch my student account for a normal account, which sadly included monthly fees.  They had a promotion at the time that if you opened a savings account at the same time, and had a set monthly transfer of at least $25 from your checking to your savings account then you could avoid monthly fees. Obviously, I opened up a savings account that day.  The things I like about my savings account are that I can transfer immediately between my checking and savings and that there are no transfer fees between my accounts. The interest rate is low though, and I know that I should be investing this money rather than just saving it, especially at my age.  This savings account is okay, but there are definitely better options out there."

They were very accommodating at the time, helped me through every step of the process and were always available to answer every question.  One time in college I got charged an overdraft fee, went to my local bank and they actually were able to remove my overdraft fee and give me a day leeway.  Which is amazing. Now that I'm out of college though they don't really have a great interest account, you can avoid the monthly fee if you have $25 transferred to a savings account every month but I definitely know that there are better banks out there.  I'm currently too lazy to switch? Which is a horrible grown-up adult thing to say.  Bottom line: They were a great bank when I was in college but now that I actually have money to invest and deal with, there are much better options out there."

The only thing I do not like is the $35 overdraft fee which sometimes can happen. A couple of times bank of america has waived it for me. I also enjoy the simplicity of their online banking!

2015-10-05,jenniferm2,jenniferm2,False,,3,"I have been with Bank of America for about 7 years. I have a checking account with direct deposit and a savings account. I wish that I could say that I am happy with them but I really am not completely happy. I stay with them mainly for convenience reasons and because it's really a huge pain to switch banks. But, that just means I have been loyal to them, not that they really care. I have a direct deposit to my account. I was away on maternity leave for 6 weeks and wasn't getting paid. They refused to waive the fee for me due to not getting direct deposit for that time. I was a new mom and a single one at that NOT getting paid at all for maternity leave and because I wasn't getting a direct deposit they charged me a fee for my savings account. After being with them for so long that was pretty infuriating. Additionally, they have charged me overdraft fees of $35 when the overdraft had not even occurred! The latest time I was charged for a daycare check that was still processing. I had money in the process of being transferred from my Paypal and the check had not even cleared and they charged the overdraft fee. Even if you overdraft by .50 they charge you a $35 fee. It's sickening. I had to fight with them for WEEKS to get that fee reversed. They refused and refused even though the Paypal money posted BEFORE the check cleared. They argued with me saying the check wasn't what put me over, that a $25 grocery store charge that had already cleared put me over which made no sense because that would only have over drafted me if they check had already been taken out of my account. They just kept talking their way around it.The customer service is ok, not great, just ok. The one thing I can say is that they are good about handling unauthorized charges. They have handled a few fraud cases for me over the past 7 years and they always get me my money back. That is probably a key factor in my staying with them.They have a banking app that is great but it doesn't always completely sync up with what they have in their system so be cognizant of that. Overall, they are ok. If you don't ever have to worry about over drafting or savings account fees, you should be fine."

My overall experience I have to say has been below average - my main issue is that I've more than once been   charged an overdraft fee of $35, when I had never actually had my account overdrafted - nor even came close to it. Each time when I brought this ridiculousness to their attention, they rectified the problem and credited my account, but in my opinion mistakes like this are unacceptable and could potentially cause significant problems for a customer, above and beyond the inherent hassles involved with making time to notify them of their errors. What if my account was funded just enough to remit a bill payment I had scheduled when they arbitrarily sucked out $35 from my account on a whim, with zero notice or notification?On the brighter side, BoA's customer service has always been reasonably helpful and attentive whenever I've needed assistance from them."

That was great because there was no fees and I didn't have to meet minimums. Once that ended I had to have so over $2500 or transfer money every month and that got a little tedious. This account doesn't really earn any tangible money in interest. Even over $15000 in the bank, I’m getting less than a quarter of a dollar per month. The service of the bank was the only saving grace because I could use the mobile app and there are always branches near me to help with any issue.

I have the ""keep the change"" monies going in directly from my checking account each month. I also like having my savings account set up to cover any accidents that might occur on my checking account with an overdraft protection. This actually did come in handy once, when a store clerk double rang my card and caused me to go into the red in my checking, my savings account had enough in it to cover it. The main thing I do not like about that is how much money they charge for you being able to use your own money to do this. This was 25 dollars it cost me and I thought that was highway robbery. It is what it is, other than that I really like my account. I would say that if they raise that rate much more, I would consider moving my account but for now since I don't plan on using overdraft protection much, It is okay."

First, the ""keep the change"" feature is almost impossible to deactivate since you have to talk to customer service and it takes really long to get transferred to a human. Second, because I kept getting money deposited in there and I can't afford to save right now, I would transfer the money back to my checking once it reached 30 dollars or more. Well, turns out they charge you after your third transaction so I ended up paying $18 dollars in fees from using it too much. Needless to say, I am no longer a bank of america customer."

B of A is also everywhere so it's a very convenient bank to have while traveling. I'd switch to a credit union, though, if there were some more close by, because I've heard they're less evil than giant banks.

2015-08-30,Judy Workman,judyw1,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,2,I liked it at first.  But when I fell behind on payments the interest kept killing me.  I got deeply in debt and tried to cancel.  They said they couldn't cancel until my payments were current.  My interest kept going up and I ended up in collections.
2015-08-27,Sara Darula,sdarula23,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,5,"I had a very positive experience with my Savings account with Bank of America.  The application process was painless.  The gentleman who assisted me was very friendly and knew every answer to all my many question.  He fully explained everything I needed to know and even what I didn't want to know.  I felt secure and safe.  I would highly recommend going through Bank of America for your savings needs! Over the years I have grown my investments and felt very confident that everything will be taken care of.  If you ever have any questions, they are either a phone call or quick office visit away.  No regrets! Thank you Bank of America!"
2015-08-27,Chris Jenkins,chrisdes,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,4,"I have had a Bank of America Savings Account for about 12 years.  In general it has served me well.  I get monthly account summaries like clockwork and whenever I have had any questions their customer service representatives have been extremely helpful.  Bank of America has transformed with the times, having apps and text features which make it much easier to access my accounts. These innovative things have truly helped keep the bank current and have assisted in making customers like myself happy.  I have never had an issue with the bank policies and I expect I will continue to have a happy relationship with Bank of America for a long time."
2015-08-27,E Miller,em,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,3,"I have had the Bank of America Savings Account for over ten years now.  Overall, I like it.  It is easy to transfer money to and from my other Bank of America accounts (ie., checking and my credit card). I am not a huge fan of the ""Keep the Change"" feature in which Bank of America takes your checking account purchases, rounds them up to the nearest dollar, and deposits that amount into your savings account. As a graduate student, there are times when my checking account runs a bit lower than I would like and having to transfer my ""Keep the Change"" dollars over from my savings account back into my checking account can get tedious."
2015-08-21,Bob Sacamano,bobs30,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"This MasterCard is Great, it pays you $100 Dollars a year just for having the Card and if you have a Savings or Checking Account with Them then you will get $120 a year instead of the $100 plus 0% interests on Purchases and Balance Transfers for 1 year....."
2015-08-21,Bob Sacamano,bobs30,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,3,This Credit Card requires an even higher level of Credit than the Cash Rewards One............The 1.5% Rewards when converted to CASH it will be only 0.9% and this Credit Card does NOT offer 0% Balance Transfers like the other ones....

2015-08-04,Lea Hopkins,leah,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"I really like my BOA checking account. I have had it for over 8 years now and no complaints. BOA has recently added a ""Cash Back"" feature, where you can pick from a list of 20-30 stores at a time and if you shop there, you will get 5-20% (depending on store) back in your account. Most of the stores are places I go regularly, like Starbucks and Sears. BOA customer service has always helped me out with issues on my checking account, specially when I was out of work and had a few Overdraft issues. They added overdraft protection for me, as well as out of courtesy removed all fees that hit my account.I think BOA is a great bank to try out if you need to open checking or savings"
2015-08-04,Asmir Dzopa,AsmirDzopa,False,Bank of America Checking,5,I have had my Checking Account with Bank of America for over 2 years now through Payoneer. This checking account was used mostly for online banking and purchasing. I have never had any problems with this bank. I have received money from my online job without a problem as well. The fees are low and withdrawing for an ATM has never been a problem. I would highly recommend this bank to anyone looking for a new checking account.
2015-08-04,jennifer,jennifer2,False,Bank of America Checking,5,My checking account with bank of America is by far the best account I have ever had. I never receive any surprise fees. Its easy to cash my checks at any atm. The customer service is always fantastic. Ive set up overdraft protection on my account. im very happy with this bank and its service. I feel like they actually care about their customers.
2015-07-30,jennifer,jennifer2,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,5,"My  experience with saving with Bank Of America has been overwhelmingly positive. I've tried the other banks and none of them compare. I can go online and check my balance. I can transfer between my savings account and bank account instantly. Any time I've ever had a problem with an overdraft fee, I spoke with customer service and was got all of the issues resolved immediately.. Everyone in customer service is helpful and friendly. You can't beat being able to put your paychecks in and directly to the ATM and getting the money in your account without even going into the bank, or speaking with a banker. Over all I would recommend this bank to anyone, friends and family included. There are never any surprise fees so you always know what you can save and what to expect from this bank."
2015-07-30,Shaneeka Anderson,uneeklr,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,4,"I've had a savings account with Bank of America for over 10 years now. When I first started, it was due to a feature they no longer offer (that I know of, as it has stopped happening on my account). Every transaction with your debit card resulted in funds automatically being rounded up to the next dollar and the difference between that amount and the actual transaction transferred to your savings account. As a result, I built a nice savings balance without much effort on my part. I have automatic transfers set up from my checking account to savings, and when it gets to a certain amount I move it to a savings CD. The rate on the CD is much better than that of the regular savings account, but the funds are not as easily accessible. Because of this, I enjoy those options. It feels good knowing money you would just have sitting around gaining interest can gain a bit more when transferred over to another savings product with a higher rate. All in all, I'm satisfied with my Bank of America savings account. I just wish they'd bring back the transaction rounding."
2015-07-28,David Weinstock,davidw,False,Bank of America Checking,3,I've had a checking account here for at least six years. I've never had any major problems and so have never needed any serious customer service support to resolve major problems. I considered closing the account due to the monthly fee that results when you don't have any real income however I kept it because of ease of access when traveling domestically and in Canada. I had no issues accessing my money in any part of the US. I would recommend an checking account here based solely on this. The online and mobile banking systems are competent easy to use and I have never had problems with them.
2015-07-27,Sophia,whocares,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,4,"I've been a Bank of America customer for several years now and decided to apply for a card while rebuilding my credit. I figured that it would help that we already have a prior relationship, and I wanted the card solely as a means of building better credit. I qualified for the Better Balance Rewards card, which gives me $30 every quarter so long as I pay more than the minimum monthly balance every month (it's $25 a quarter for non-BoA banking customers). This is easy for me since I mainly just use it to buy lunch or coffee a couple times a month. When I first qualified, I also got a year at 0% APR, which was helpful when I had an emergency auto repair."
2015-07-23,Rick,thisisricksemail,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"One time I tried to make a purchase while money was in transit from savings to checking.  Since the transfer wasn't complete, my checking account overdrafted and tried to withdraw the funds from savings (which had already been emptied). This caused savings to overdraft and attempt to withdraw from checking.  Everyday for a week both accounts would overdraft and attempt to withdraw from each other, racking up $60 in fees a day. Customer service acknowledged that it was a flaw on their end but they had no authorization to refund the fees."
2015-07-20,Dipti,dineh,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"Signed with Bank of America in 2013. Seemed like a great deal, especially with the monthly fee being waived since I was a student. My favorite part about BoA was student credit card. I also like their online banking platform. It is convenient to check my balances and make all my payments all from one website."

2015-07-16,Kenneth Parkins,parkins5322,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"I have enjoyed my BoA checking account for a few years with little very few problems.  One of my biggest frustrations has actually happened twice, for some reason they moved the money from my direct deposit that was supposed to be in checking over to my savings account, this was back when I actually paid my bills with paper checks, and 7 of them bounced.  After I got letters from multiple accounts saying that I had bounced check fees I inquired.  BoA did a really good job though and paid all the fees and reversed all the fees they had issued me.  All in all I like my account with them alot and would recommend them."
2015-07-15,Zachary M Lang,zlang34,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,2,"I had a really bad experience banking with Bank of America. I used Bank of America solely as a savings account and I had a terrible experience. The application process was quick and easy, they had no problem getting me signed up and having me deposit my money. After signing up is when it all went down hill. After the first month I looked at my savings account and realized money was taken out, albeit it was only a little amount. So I call Bank of America and find out that there is a fee that was not disclosed when I signed up. I talked to two different managers and they said there was nothing they could do about it, while being rather rude."
2015-07-15,JAMES ELLEDGE,DJPHAT,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,3,"It is not the best rates out there but it is extremely convenient if you already have accounts with Bank of America.  You can open it up right from your on-line portal and start a CD immediately.  The customer service is really good, I used on-line chat to help set it up since it was after branch location banking hours.  It is a nice option for short terms savings that keeps you from getting to your money easily and encourages me to set back some money for some larger purchases I have coming up in the less than 3 year time frame."
2015-07-14,erica d,bearica,False,Bank of America Checking,5,"I love this bank. I currently have two banks, one that is linked to my family's account, and this one that I use as my personal bank. I primarily got this bank to obtain a credit card, but I have since moved away from my other bank to solely use this one. I think it has a lot of strengths on its own, but especially in comparison. The interface of the website is friendly, appealing and is functional. Every bit of information I could want from statements, account information, important numbers, and ways to sign up for other programs or open accounts is right there. Customer service is very quick. I have used both the online chat and telephone calls for help with an issue with instant service. I had an issue where I was over drafted for an unauthorized charge and I wasn't aware of it. After using the card a few times, I had an even larger overdraft due to insufficient funds - but all due an unauthorized charge. I called and everything was immediately fixed and smoothed over.Another situation happened that I can't quite remember how it all panned out, but since I had been responsible with that account and the credit account linked, they had given me a benefit for being a good customer. Bank of America has not left me in the dust like my other bank has, and has made it a point to emphasize its appreciation for me being a customer. I don't think customer affirmation is necessarily important, after all I'm being offered a service that is functional, but it makes me feel a lot closer to the bank. Other local things, the hours for the banks meet my needs whenever I need to talk to someone, and I like that I can make deposits through the ATM. The bank employees are all very friendly whenever I do need to talk to them, but I haven't had a dire need to go inside of the bank in about 4 months."
2015-07-14,christian ro,speakerboxxer02,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"I have been banking with Bank of America since 2004. I have had the good fortune of never really running into any major issues. My favorite part about banking with Bank of America is their online banking platform. It easy really easy and convenient for me to check my balances and make all my payments all from one website. I would also say that they are probably one of the better banks to help protect with Identy theft. I have had lost cards in the past but it was always easy to get them turned off by phone and have them send me a new one. They even verify all your recent purchases with you so you have peace of mind that the lost card hasn't been used since you lost it. The only thing that I don't like about my checking account is when they put a temporary block on my card because of irregular spending. This has happened maybe six times to me ever, but it is really inconvenient. It is pretty easy to get the hold taken off the account by just calling customer service and verifying that it is you that has been using the card, but just an inconvenience."
2015-07-14,nichole,ndmccarty,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"I enjoy using Bank of America. It's an easy and fast way to deposit money anywhere. Awesome online banking system, very easy to use and understand. Good customer service anywhere, I travel quite a bit and can always easily reach an actual person on the phone very quickly. Low monthly checking fees and they have a great traveler's credit card that helps you earn a lot of money back."
2015-07-08,Luke Miller,lukem1,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,3,"Overall, this is a fairly average travel rewards card that provides average benefits in comparison to other similar cards. The 1.5% Rewards is a nice feature, and those points do really add up if you are a frequent traveler. The bonus points awarded are a little skimpy in comparison to other cards out there, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card which offers 40,000 points if you spend $4000 in the first 3 months. This is not a bad card, but there are better options."

When I originally signed up, I had a student savings account as I was in college but it was changed to a regular account after I graduated (I believe it automatically switched over after a set number of years). I really like the Keep the Change feature which rounds purchases up to the nearest dollar and deposits the change into your saving account when you link up your checking account. This has made it very easy for me to save. I love Bank of America's mobile app and how easy it is to transfer money from checking to savings and vise versa. The interest rate is not as good as some competitors but with the various tools that Bank of America offers, I have kept this account rather than opening a new one at another bank."
2015-07-05,Dave Slattery,daves13,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,"I got this card because I like AAA.  The credit card, however, I did not like.  First of all, they'd send me a bill every OTHER month, so when I got it, I always had a late fee on it, which I had to call and get removed.  Second, I had a charge from a company that auto-charged me.  I called and asked them to cancel and remove the charge, and the company refused.  I called the credit card company and tried to dispute it, but they said, ""nah, it's in their terms and conditions"".  Credit card companies should PROTECT CONSUMERS from this kind of crap, and they DIDN'T!  So 1 star for you AAA."

2015-06-30,Henry Gonzalez,gerodr,False,,4,"I have previously complained about the fact that Bank of America charges an exorbitant $12 monthly service charge for accounts that do not keep a balance over so many thousands of dollars. First and foremost, this means (statistically) that over half of the United States must pay fees in order to bank with Bank of America. On two occasions, however, the Bank of America customer service folks were gracious enough to reverse these fees into my account."
2015-06-30,Henry Gonzalez,gerodr,False,Bank of America Checking,3,"I have a checking account with Bank of America. First and foremost, I find it extremely frustrating that they only have Monday through Friday customer service, with limited hours. Additionally, I am paying a $12 monthly fee. As a former Wells Fargo client, I remember having free accounts by meeting certain requirements (savings acct linked, bill pay). They also had 24 hour customer service. At the very least, I would expect customer service to be readily available. They do, however, have very good policies as far as reversal of fees."
2015-06-24,Eugene Salganik,eugenes_8,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,Horrible card. Horrible service. Incompetent people. Can't get ANYTHING resolved. Stay away from Spirit and its incompetent credit cards partners.
2015-06-23,Nate T-A,Locke,False,Bank of America Checking,4,This checking account is alright. The only bad part is the overdraft fees. It's fun that they will put your picture on your card if you ask. I also like that they have a lot of ATMs. They have minimal fees but not-none. You can expect one or two fees a year plus the monthly fee that comes with the account.
2015-06-23,Briana Lee,brianal1,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,2,I had a Bank of America Savings account. I decided to close it after a Customer Service Rep decided to argue with me about how many times in a billing cycle I can withdraw money from my savings account. My mother worked for a bank so I know the total amount of times I am allowed to withdraw without penalty. The rep was rude and mean. I immediately went to the branch the next day and closed my savings account with them. I also explained to the lady that I saw that day the reason for why I was closing and she repeatedly apologized to me saying that is not how a rep should have spoke to me and was there anyway that they could get me to stay. I did not want to keep my savings open with them any longer so I closed it. I will not open another savings account with Bank Of America for a few years if not longer.
2015-06-23,brantely duck,brantelyd,False,Bank of America Checking,4,Bank Of America Core Checking has worked very well for me. The online bill pay is great and there are no hidden fees. As long as you make sure you have enough money in your account everything is fine. I would like to see custom designs for the debit cards. Uploading an image online that is placed on your card would be rather cool. One last thing. Watch out for out of network ATM fees!
2015-06-23,Logitech Scotch,logitechs,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,4,I have this card for about five months and I pretty much had a salt and sweet taste to it. The thing that I really loved about this Bank of America Card was that it had higher cash back reward than most other credit cards in the market currently. The thing that really hate about this card is its online interface. The website is just pure madness so don't even get me stared on the login which is more confusing than learning how to fly a helicopter. Overall besides its ups and downs I really loved this card.
2015-06-18,Ryan Wackerly,retroryan81,False,Bank of America Checking,5,I have been with Bank of America for 10 years now and have never been a happier customer.  Their customer service is top notch and have great benefits for the checking accounts and awesome rates for their savings account.  I would highly recommend this bank to anyone that asks. Bank of America's app is also a great feature. Being able to deposit checks through my phone is an amazing feature. They have always worked with me in unique situations and never blanketed me with generalized solutions to my financial needs. It would take a lot for me to switch banks and be treated the same way. I am known by name at my local branch and feel like part of a community.

Somethings that I love about it are the high interest that I earn on the cash I have saved away. Other things that are great about the account is that BOA has allowed me and the misses to establish a joint account that we each contribute too  in order to save up money for funding trips, college funds for our children etc. The staff is always very nice and helpful when working with our savings account and especially making transfers between banks. We also tend to use Online Banking when we manage this account and it is quite easy to navigate through our options. Customer service is also always a pleasure to speak with when we have concerns!"

Makes it real easy to save and keep track of your checking balance!"
2015-06-09,Samuel Shiroff,shiroff,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,4,"I have been a Bank of America customer for about 3 years.  The savings account is linked to all of my other accounts. I am most satisfied with the online service. This functions rather well with one exception. I am greeted when I log in with opportunities to learn more about other services. When I click, however, it never works. Thus I feel I might be missing out on something. The fact that virtually no interest is paid on the savings accounts also makes them rather useless - but that is more a consequence of the current era of cheap money than BoA's fault.  The transfers between accounts is easy and lightening fast, so overall I am pleased with the service."

The 2% for groceries and 3% for gas cash back amount is a very attractive offer that this card has.  Also, the $100.00 bonus upon using your card, and the 0% for 12 months make this card a wonderful credit card.  I would definitely recommend this card to anyone."
2015-06-09,Randy Smith,sofaslug,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,3,"I think there are some good and bad things with this card. A 25 day grace period is nice, in case you are having trouble paying on time but that APR can get a little high. Personally, I would never use a card that could shoot up to almost 23% after a year. The smart chip is an essential tool to have in a new card so I do like that. Again, I would never take out a cash advance with a 15% fee. It would make more sense to take the time to take a bank loan out instead."
2015-06-05,Sansana Sawasdikosol,sansanas1,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"I have been a long time customer of BoA.  I like the service, but I do have one major complain about the fee.  There shouldn't be any fee for things like wire transfer fee if you maintain a certain minimum balance.  You waive the monthly fee for checking if you have direct deposit.  Why do you need to stick me with a fee when someone send me money via wire transfer.  Some times the amount is so little that after the transfer fee is applied, the money is gone."

It never hits at midnight, and when I call to ask why, the customer service representative tried to convince me that my job hadn't sent it to the bank yet, despite my job emailing me after it had been sent. I don't pay a monthly fee though since my check gets direct deposited every month. Overall, the account is a great basic checking account. My biggest dislike is that my paychecks are never processed at midnight like other banks."

Besides that every issue has been resolved, I hope they gain the good reputation they had before but overall they are very trustworthy."
2015-06-02,Michelle Olin,michelle_olin_75,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"We got a BOA travel card for an upcoming trip to Europe. The primary reason for doing so was that we wanted to avoid international transaction fees. It worked will in Europe, in several of the EU countries. We also like that it has numerous cash-back offers that we take advantage of, in addition to the point reward system. We have gotten several dollars back that way and it is a pretty good deal as far as credit card rewards go. We have not had a problem with fraud with this card. An international traveler looking for a good card from a strong bank would make a good choice to go with this card."
2015-06-01,Elizabeth Henry,Hawaii12,False,Bank of America Checking,5,I have been banking with Bank of America for over twenty years now. The only complaint I really have is concerning the overdraft fees. I know that I did enroll into the bank's overdraft protection program to save me from them. I can tell that I have really seen that option benefit me. Another reason I stay at this bank is because it is in walking distance from where I live and the tellers are wonderful.

The bank I was using was an online only bank and the mortgage company wouldn't approve it. So I searched around in a panic, looking for a bank. Bank of America has the best hours, the most locations and ATMs for my area, and amazing customer service. When I went in and explained my situations, they went out of their way to get my account opened, immediately transferred the monies from my other account, and made it available immediately (which is VERY uncommon). She new all the tricks to get my account open smoothly and quickly, with no wait time at all. She even went out of her way to fax the new bank info to the mortgage company for me and waited well past the bank's closing time  to make sure the mortgage company didn't need anything else. Needless to say, I was able to close on my house that day, thanks to Bank of America. They were true life savers!!"

I have had no real problems with Bank of America though some of their corporate practices make me uncomfortable."
2015-05-29,Tally Browning,TB_Star,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,4,"I prefer Bank of America Savings over their checking account. I don't really dip into my savings account so the interest earned is a lot more noticeable even though the rate is still fairly low. I have it linked to my checking account and I'm enrolled in the Keep The Change program which is a cool way to just edge a little bit more into your savings. It's a really cool way to add to your savings even if you never really bother to save your money. You save either way with this program and I especially like it because it feels like a bonus to what I already in. The monthly fees are pretty low, which is great. There's not much that I don't like about the savings account. Other banks definitely have better offers and higher interest rates but I'm pretty satisfied at Bank of America."
2015-05-29,Tally Browning,TB_Star,False,Bank of America Checking,3,I've used Bank of America exclusively for a number of years. What I like about it is how available its locations and ATMs are. Even in remote areas you can still access a bank/ATM. They have e-banking and paper bills as well which is convenient and good for tax/accounting purposes. The overdraft system is pretty good. They charge you every time you go over but they do allow quite a few purchases over the limit you have. I recommend overdraft protection if you're the kind of person who aimlessly card slides. What I don't like is that the interest you earn is pretty negligible. You might as well not even be earning any for the low conversion rate. It also has a ton of fees which almost come off as them scraping the bottom of the barrel any way they can to get funds out of customers. It's really sheisty and I'm kind of over it.

My problems arose when I tried to close my account, go figure. I closed the account and they were still sending me statements for 3-4 months that showed zero balance, I called them and they said its standard and basically blew me off."

Not so easy, according to Bank of America travel dept. We have now waited more than 40 days to see a refund posted to our account, even collecting emails from supervisors saying ""it will be 7-10 business days"" Well, we are waaay past that and I would issue a warning to anyone considering using them. It DOES NOT take 40+ days to issue a refund. Wondering if they will be paying the interest that is accruing also!! Our ML investment people talked us into getting this card. Somehow feel really taken on this whole thing…."

I've had a bad expirence just trying to make payments on my credit card - I have to jump through hoops every month I try to make payments?!?! Apprently I didn't verify my account in time so now they lock me out every month and want me to print out a form with my full account & routing number on it to mail in (doesn't seem secure?). Everytime I call I am on hold for at least 10 min.  All I want to do is login and make a payment like I do with all my other credit cards, is that too much to ask? They were even willing to lose me as a card holder becuase I refused to mail in my account & routing number - wow!"

2015-05-22,Katie,kwill,False,Bank of America Checking,3,"I have used Bank of America for almost 10 years and while it has been convenient in that there are many ATMs all over the U.S., I have not appreciated their various fees and requirements for the accounts. Also, the overdraft fee is kind of high but thankfully I have had it removed when I go into the branch. The people I have worked with have been very nice but I definitely prefer a local credit union over a big bank."
2015-05-20,Amanda Campbell,aj.campbell,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,4,"I have had a savings account with BOA for a few years now. I find it easy to have this account, as there are locations all over the US - I can deposit with a teller, and also at an ATM - I can withdraw from the same locations. Also, the mobile app allows me to transfer funds to and from my savings and other accounts. They do limit me to three total transfers per month, so I keep a close eye on my amount of transfers so that they don't charge me a fee. Overall, I am satisfied with the savings account."
2015-05-20,Amanda Campbell,aj.campbell,False,Bank of America Checking,3,"I've been a loyal BOA customer for a few years now after switching from Chase. I do like the account, which waives my monthly fees with a direct deposit linked to my account, however, I have some issues with the way the bank processes daily withdrawals and credits. I have been charged a couple of times for over limit fees, which I do not feel were rightfully charged. BOA chooses to process debits, then credits to each account, in that order. Meaning, if you deposit money to cover a charge when your balance is close to 0 (to post on the same day as the debit), you will definitely get charged an over limit fee, because they charge the debit, you go below 0, then they apply the credit to your account, then they take out their fee. I have talked to a couple of CSRs about this issue and no one is helpful."
2015-05-20,Josh,jtw33,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"This checking account is fine for basic checking.  The interest checking would be nice but why keep that kind of balance level when the rates are pitiful?  The most irritating issue with this account is the ATM fees.  I love Bank of America's services in general as I have many different accounts with them but it feels like the ATM fees are painful if you withdrawal from a non-BOA ATM.  Unless you are in a big city, there are not BOA branches or ATMs on every corner.  It would be nice if BOA either reduced or eliminated the ATM fees for some or all of their checking accounts."
2015-05-16,Heath Dacus,heathd1,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,5,"As a savings account only you'll be better off with Capital One, or Barclay. They pay at 7 to 10x better than Bank Of America's money market accounts. (Either way savings accounts aren't making any real money lately)With that said though combined with their cash rewards card 10% reward boost when deposited in savings, and bankamerideals, you can make around $300 to $500 in profits with this account in a year. Just place $300 in savings and use it as an awards saving net, and move the profits into a real savings account, or extra payment into an IRA."
2015-05-15,Stephanie Fast,stephanief1,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,3,"I opened this savings account about five months ago because I was interested in the higher interest rates, a significant amount higher than a regular savings account. I set up an automatic transfer every week to two weeks but because my balance wasn't high enough I was charged $12 a month to keep the account open. I believe this is a great account if you have enough funds in it to keep the fees down but the interest was not making anywhere near the $12 a month so I had to close the account down because it continued to cost me money."
2015-05-15,Myles Lindeburg,grendelone,False,Bank of America Checking,2,"I had a Bank of America checking account, about seven years ago, prior to my current checking and bank that I love. I had noticed over the years that Band of America would que up my debit card transactions and process them in batches. They would show as pending for sometimes up to a week long. I never really thought about why they did it until I found out the hard way one day. One Thursday night before payday, I inadvertently used my debit card one too many times and I did overdraw thinking it would be in pending for days. NO, BOA decided to clear that transaction in lightening speed and proceeded to process the rest of the transactions as well in an order that created the most overdraw fees possible for them. If they would have processed all transactions in order then I would have only one overdraft fee, but in the order they processed the transactions it caused an onslaught of overdraft fees. As each fee ate up more available money which caused another transaction to bounce. Rinse and repeat. Needless to say it wrecked that paycheck and they lost a customer for life."

Seemed like a great deal, especially with the monthly fee being waived since I am a student. Turned out this wasn't so though as I got charged the fee and it over drafted my account and charged me another fee for over drafting! It was absolutely ridiculous but luckily with a few calls I was able to sort things out, great customer service, they really listen to you."
2015-05-14,Thomas Grylka,thomasg_23,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,4,The introductory offers on this card are spectacular for anyone who like to travel. It's not difficult to meet the cards requirement within the first month and if you do you pretty much already have a paid plane ticket to California! I like this card for its low fees and its great rewards and it also is a very safe card to use with it's smartchip. It's similar to a Capitol One Venture Card in that way that it makes traveling much easier and spending much funner but the rewards with Capitol One are hard to beat. Definitely recommend this BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card to anyone who's budget it fits in.
2015-05-11,Chantelle Smith,chantelles,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,"This is the worst credit card I've ever had.  I was offered the 15,000 bonus miles for the card after making my first purchase.  It's been 3 months since I did so, and I have not been able to receive the bonus miles.  I've called both Bank of America and Spirit (8+ times between the two of them).  You cannot get a Spirit representative on the phone without pretending to book a flight (the entire customer service center is automated except for that).  When I spoke to a representative, they indicated I needed to go through their website.  I've done that 3 times now and they do not help me, just give me a standard answer which is unrelated.  STAY AWAY from this card - Spirit has lied about this promotion and refuses to even speak to me, leaving me with no recourse.  There's no point in 2x miles on every dollar when they're so difficult to work with.Additionally, your miles expire if you don't make a purchase Every Single Month."
2015-05-08,Kris Reed,JumboMac,False,Bank of America Checking,2,"I was with bank of america a few years ago and after dealing with the monthly fees I was near the end of my ropes. The straw that broke the camels back is when I found out they were going to be initiating a charge for every time you used your debit card. I think they eventually rejected that idea once the bad press came out, but just knowing they were considering it was enough for me to leave them and head to a credit union. I haven't looked back since."

I wasn't on as a joint account holder at the time because he left suddenly so they had to have him call in to have them reverse the fee. Meanwhile he can't call for a couple months so these fees keeping adding up every day and when he returned and explained he was military and unable to call in and could even provide proof they said too bad. He was forced to either pay all those fees for a small computer error or close his account. Needless to say, we will never bank with them again or recommend anyone to bank with them. The error was a transaction for 16$ that was taken out twice, then one was put back all within a fraction of a second but it was enough to put us in the negative and accrue fees."

I also like that there are no annual fees which in turn can help save you a lot of money,and the cash reward bonus is a great idea while in turn with the cash back. The only thing I did not like in my opinion is the balance transfer fee because it charges you 3% of whatever you are transferring, and the max penalty APR is kind of high."
2015-05-07,INDA Blackwell,Indanila77,False,Bank of America Checking,5,I absolutely love Bank of America.  I love the fact that I do not have extra fees if my account is overdrawn while a still have a few bucks in my account.  This has been a lifesaver on many different occasions.  I also love the fact that I can get a large sum of money at the ATM.  Other banking institutions have a much lower withdrawal amount.  Overall I am really pleased with Bank of America and see myself having accounts with them for a long time.

There's a number of things I appreciate about their service. First off, they have a full range of products that they can offer. Whether it be checking, savings, credit cards, lending, online banking, mobile banking, etc. they have everything.I have also been impressed with how well all of their products work in tandem. It's important for me to be able to move money around between and among various personal and business accounts, deposit checks with my mobile phone app, easily send money to vendors or pay bills.Finally, while they are a massive bank and organization, I still get great service at my local branch. I go to them whenever I need something or I am not comfortable calling their service center, and I have never had a problem."

Hello, Florida! The best part is that the points don't expire. Out of all the cards I've used for traveling, I've never seen this. Everyone knows points expire - but these don't. They're like miracle points. You can also use the points not only for flights, but for rental cars, hotels (and some really cool hotels, I might add.) Great card if you're looking to rack up travel points - I would definitely recommend."

I have had a checking account with them for over 10 years and they have been great. The only issue I've ever had is that I didn't realize that if you don't have direct deposits going into your account regularly, you have to pay a small monthly service charge. I had never run up against this until I quit my job and became self employed. I can't really blame that on Bank of America too much though because it's likely they told me and I just forgot. Overall though, I have been extremely happy with Bank of America and the fact that there are branches all over the US and that they coordinate with the Bank of Nova Scotia in Canada makes them super convenient to use."

My available credit line was $3,500 and I had carried a balance on it for years that I was slowly paying off. I decided to make a $1,500 payment reducing what was owed on the card down to less than $800.Guess what happened?The very next day Bank of America did a ""Periodic review of my credit"" and decided to reduce my credit line down to $800!!! What's worse is they didn't even notify me! When I questioned it customer service and the supervisor said that my credit wasn't good enough for the credit line I had. But I have the best credit I've had in years! They spun lines of BS and tried to tell me that the ""periodic review"" had nothing to do with me paying my card down and that they had no intention of fixing the issue, ever. So what's really happening?Bank of America is doing something known as ""chasing the balance"" in order to  increase their profits. Now if I don't make a large enough payment I'll be over my credit line and be subject to fees. If I make to big of a payment they'll reduce my credit line even further! If you want to be able to use your credit card and pay off the balance eventually, stay away from Bank of America! -Unethical Business Practices. -Lying Customer Service Center-Terrible Treatment of Long Term CustomersBEWARE:  Stay clear of Bank of America Credit Cards!"

Top of which is 2 points per $1 for gas, grocery and drug store purchases and 3 points per $1 on all qualifying AAA and travel purchases which will really rack up the points as you use this card. Plus you can get points for other purchases to. Add this to rewards relating to car services or repair and you can save a pretty good amount of money over time.The terms are good as well and the AAA Member Rewards Credit Card has a good interest rate. It's really the rewards that set this card apart. Like the Capital One card I also have right now doesn't offer any rewards and just can't compare to this one."

I signed up for a Bank of America checking account and savings account as the nearest branch was right down the road. They have been really forgiving with overdraft fees even if it was my fault. I tried to stop-payment on a check and it was done quickly although I think the fee is a little bit high. Customer service is alright but they have a slightly complicated phone system and it isn't simple to get help with what you are looking for.

It basically the same thing besides the charge, which isn't really that bad at $12 per month. One thing that I wish that they could be better about is posting things on the same day which you deposit them. I have deposited money after work and been charged an overdraft fee because the money I had deposited the night before actually wasn't available until the next day. Sometimes its not available until monday which really sucks if you make a deposit late friday night. I feel like most people get paid on fridays and some work later then others. I think that they should extend it,especially since its all done by ATMs and computers anyways."

Currently, I use my Chase Freedom and it does not provided as high of a percentage of Cash Back for food and gas.  Aside from the Cash Back benefit, the percentage rate is a tad bit lower than my Chase Freedom card.

I had no complaints until I received in the mail a claim form for a lawsuit that was filed against BofA for unfairly charging customers overdraft fees. I went over my statements for the previous 2 years and found out that indeed I was one of those customers who was treated despicably. The bank would not post any transactions on the weekend and would show them as pending. When Monday came the pending transactions posted but they would take the highest debit, regardless of the time of the transaction, and apply that to the account first. Then the next highest and so on. The affect this had was that the largest transactions would overdraw the account and the smaller debits would each incur an overdraft fee. They did this solely to take advantage of their customers instead of posting transaction in the order in which they were made."

Everything is clearly disclosed and there are NO surprises. If there are any problems, you can talk to someone online, in person, or on the phone.

Choosing Bank of America was a HUGE mistake. There were so many hidden fees associated with the account by the time I received my first monthly statement I didn't have any money left in my account. Be careful of minimum deposit fees, ATM withdraw fees (even if it is a Bank of America ATM), and over the limit withdraw fees. When I tried to go into the bank and call customer service they were rude. My issue was not a concern in their eyes. I will never bank with Bank of America again in my life."

This might not sound like a big deal but it really adds up over time, especially if you're diligent about keeping your balance paid off. Combine that with a very competitive interest rate and you have an all-around solid card.Compare to other reward cards which might offer reward points but not automatic money back on purchases, gas, and groceries. You really can't beat this card."

I've had my bank account since 2009 and haven't had any major problems at all. The only service fee I ever get is on my savings account and that is $5 a month. I find their mobile and online banking to be really convenient and I use the mobile app almost every single day to keep track of purchases and make transfers. One time someone tried using my debit card in Texas fraudulently and Bank of America contacted me right away, shut my card off, and then resolved everything within minutes of it all happening. That's something I really appreciate. I also love their free ATM services and that there are locations all over the place and on every corner. I've never had to use an ATM that charges me an arm and a leg in this town because of that. The only thing I could say is that their processing times could be quicker because sometimes I think I have more money then I actually do because things take so long to process."

If I walk into a store or even call them, I feel valued and don't feel like another annoying phone call. I have been able to save money and not dish out all my savings to some company which is great.

I get emails to remind me when my statements are made available.  You can set up various alerts to let you know if you get a deposit, withdrawal, balance falls below a certain limit.  You can really set up an alert for most anything!I initially was unaware there was a fee with this account unless I tied it to my checking or maintained a balance so seeing that monthly fee pop up was shocking.  I simply tied it to my checking so I don't have to worry about the fees anymore.  Interest rates are what are at this point at 3% you can't beat it.  It's better than the 1% so I'll take the 3%."
2015-03-26,Monica Boska,mbosk,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"I transferred my checking to Bank of America after a horrendous experience at Charter one.  I could not be happier with my BOA account.  I set it up with my direct deposit, so I don't have a monthly fee to maintain and the best part is that if i ever overdraft it simply takes the money out of my savings.  The only thing I don't understand is that most of the time there isn't a fee for this, but every now and then I see a $10 charge.  Besides that, I love that I can deposit checks using my phone.  The app is fantastic.  Transferring funds between my accounts or to other people is also a breeze.  When the data breach happened at Home Depot, they sent me an email stating they were sending me a new debit card  They do all the work of being sure that anything suspicious on my account, they look into it.  The first time they froze my account, I was irritated but knowing why they did it, I now have peace of mind that they are watching out for my money.  They will call and email you so you know there is a hold due to some suspicious activity.So, I love my account and won't be going anywhere any time soon!"
2015-03-26,andie,mturkreviewer,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"I opened my BOA account when I went to college because it was one of the banks close to my college campus. I really enjoyed that I didn't have to pay any fees to maintain my account while I was a student. However, now that I am over the age of 23, I have to pay a fee of $12 unless I maintain a certain balance or a specific amount of direct deposit. While this is not an issue because I typically meet both requirements, it can be a hassle to make sure that both are met so I don't have to pay the fee. Other than that, I have no complaints. They are a very good bank with great customer service who are always willing to help!"

This card has amazing bonuses with fairly low spending requirements to meet get those rewards. Also, the 0% introductory for 12 months offer is amazing. Using the bonus points for flights, hotels, car rentals, and tons more is a great offer. All of this matched with the fairly low interest rate and the annual 10% bonus makes this card a must have."
2015-03-25,James Perez,JamesJon,False,Bank of America Checking,5,"I've had this account for a couple years now and so far have been pleased. It's low cost, but it gets the job done for what I need. I do most of my banking online and the BoA UI is easy to use. Additionally, I was overdrafted twice (my fault, gotta pay attention to those monthly autobill charges) and their rep was able to reduce my penalties. Overall I would strongly recommend the account."
2015-03-25,Steve Irvan,dreadmime,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"Bank of America is a great bank. I had been using Chase for years, but started to get tired of all these new fees they kept charging. I was paying almost $100/month in various ""fees"" with Chase, and no matter how many times I called to have this rectified, they absolutely refused to fix it. So we switched to Bank of America and haven't looked back. There's BofA ATM's everywhere, so pulling cash out of an ATM is hassle free. Most of their branches (of which there are many) have 4 or 5 ATM's instead of 1 or 2 like most banks, so no waiting in a long line! Checking is actually *free* if you have Direct Deposit. No tricky hidden fees! I have had some various issues that weren't clear when I opened the account, but after talking with customer service, I found them in the agreement I signed but failed to completely read. Still, great company."

It was the first checking (and savings) account I ever opened on my own. It was very easy to open the account initially, especially given that I was 16 years old and enrolled in a student checking account with no fees. Over time, however, I experienced monthly fees, to the tune of $12 per month. These fees were only removed if I enrolled in direct deposit AND set up a monthly deposit from my checking to my savings. I feel these fees are not warranted AT ALL."

This card is awesome, I love that the rewards don't expire for five whole years, so that I can watch them accumulate and feel great about it.  I previously had the standard BOA cash rewards card, and was amazed to find that this one offers 25% more cash rewards, which is awesome.  Love this card."
2015-03-20,Shayna A,shaynaadelman,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,4,"It goes without saying that the AAA Member Rewards Credit Card is the best deal for AAA members.  You earn 3 points per $1 on AAA and travel purchases which is a very nice perk if you travel a lot.  You earn 1 point per dollar spent elsewhere which isn't that exciting.The APR ranges from 12.99% - 22.99% which goes from decent/good to never carry a balance land.  There is no annual fee which is a big plus.  A lot of rewards cards have crazy annual fees which can sneak up on you.For comparison sake, I also looked at the Citi ThankYou Preferred Card.  That card also has no annual fee and the APR rate range is the same.  It offers 2 ThankYou Points per dollar spent on dining at restaurants and entertainment and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. They also offer 20,000 bonus if you spend $1500 in the first three months which is worth $200 and 0% intro APR on purchases and transfers for 12 months.  If you are a big spender this card may be a better fit.For AAA members who like a simple rewards system the AAA Member Rewards Credit Card is a good deal."

These type purchases can add up pretty quickly earning the user a decent reward just for its use. I also  like the cash bonus which is a nice incentive, however, my major concern with using this card is the high cash advance fee, I just do not understand it.  If you are borrowing from your own account and will be repaying why is the fee so high?"
2015-03-17,Ritu Choudhary,rituc1,False,Bank of America Checking,2,Although most checking accounts have minimum balance and fees for all sort of things Bank of America has the highest of them all.. I have been charged from $25-$75 for not maintaining minimum balance for a day or if direct deposit setup by my company came a few days late.. Other banks usually listen to genuine delays and will reverse the charges but Bank of America never does that.. In fact they will charge a penalty and then the balance will go below minimum threshold and they will put another penalty on that... May be it is just my branch associate (Houston TX) but they never reverse the charges.. I am closing my account with them and moving to chase.. I will also recommend looking into capital one 360 checking account which is all online and doesnt require minimum balance...

They don't care about the individual customer. They will charge you for every little thing they can. Things most banks give for free like checks and things like that. BoA will charge you for. Of course they have the monthly maintenance fees, and bad ATM fees which don't get reimbursed. There's no reason to be with Bank of America any longer. In my opinion, there are so many better banks out there."

Once I told a friend about my experiences with Bank of america, they recommended a better bank and I moved on. In this day and age, monthly maintenance fees and hidden charges are a thing of the past. These big banks need to catch up."

I had pretty good credit when I applied so I have in the lower range for my APR which is one of my biggest concerns when I choose a credit card. I also really like the introductory rate of zero percent for the first fifteen months. It comes with overdraft protection, I have never used so that does not really matter to me. All banks seemed to have raised their late fees up and this one is no exception to that. The twenty five day grace period is nice but the cash advance feel is steep and the APR for cash advance is almost twenty five percent. It does have a smart chip and online banking as all banks should these days and all in all, it is a decent card I have had no problems with."

For anyone who travels a lot, this card would a smart decision. Not only does it offer 1.5 points for every dollar spent (my current card only offers 1), it gives you 3 points for every dollar spent on travel. With the price of airfare being what it is today, those points will add up quick! Add that to the $100 dollar bonus you get for signing up, and this card is definitely a winner."

I have been a customer with them for years, and have never been disappointed.  The mobile app is very useful for depositing checks, checking balances, paying bills, etc.  They do not charge for bill pay, which is nice.  My only complaint is that occasionally in the past, they post transactions in an odd order, so I've been hit with an overdraft fee when I really shouldn't have.  But they will sometimes waive it, if your argument is compelling enough.  Other than that, I love this account!"

Except that I don't really want to find a new bank I have no reason to stay with Bank of America.  Their locations are convenient but their customer service leaves a lot to be desired.  They're a huge banking institution and nickle and dime their small customers.  ATM card not working?  $5.00.  No free checks.  Nothing for loyal customers, no exceptions.  If there were other banks convenient to my home and office I'd leave in a heartbeat."
2015-03-09,Freda Brown,jamnwhistler,False,Bank of America Checking,5,"I have had serious problems with overdraft charges in the past.  Before the Obama administration changed the rules, I had several situations where an unexpected charge would come in and cause a cascade of overdraft charges.  For example, I recall having a Starbucks charge for 2 dollars and something else came in and created an overdraft of less than a dollar.  All the other postings for that day then were also overdrafts .  And each overdraft created a fee of 35 dollars!  I am on a limited retirement income, so these occasions were total disasters.  I've forgotten now how the rules have changed, but since they did, I have not had this situation arise again.  On the rare occasion when I have had a single overdraft fee, the customer service people have been wonderful in reversing it."

I also get the monthly maintenance fee waived by linking it with my checking accounts. For this I am happy. I also am enrolled in a ""keep the change"" program"", which rounds each of my transactions in my checking account up to a whole number, and transfers the ""loose change"" into my savings account. This helps me inadvertently save money. Although it seems small, I invest a good amount into my savings via the program. I have never been charged a fee in my savings account, and have actually gotten some money back from BOA since they matched some of my Keep the Change money back when I opened the account. Until something goes wrong, I won't be going anywhere."

One I use for my bills (i.e rent, utilities, car payments, phone, etc.), the other I use for general spending. I have not really come across any problems except for the monthly maintenance fee. I think that $12 is too much for a month. Since I get direct deposit in one of the accounts, the fee is waived, but the other account gets it each month! That is $144 a month which I think is a little high. My Debit card that is linked to my account has also been flagged for ""fraud or suspicious activity"" and been cancelled a few times. I don't mind them monitoring my card, but inform me or call me and ask if its ""suspicious""."

I love being able to snap a picture of my check and have it deposited into my checking account without stepping foot in a bank. Awesome feature of their bank. To avoid the fees all you have to do is keep a minimum of $1500 in your account which has never been an issue! I have over drafted 4 times and they waived the fee every time!! So awesome bank overall!"

My main issue with this account is that, it is basically like any other savings account, except they charge ridiculous fees on top of it. I signed up with them off of brand name alone which was a big mistake. Once I realized just how much they charge you just to store your money there, I closed the account and moved the money to a free savings account. The fees are just too much and are completely unnecessary."

With that being said, I really love the card and the bonuses that are included (they update cash back bonuses regularly), but the reason I gave this card 3 stars is because of the customer service. I recently had my card stolen and I called to cancel the card and was informed that I would have a replacement sent to me in the next 10 business days. It is currently March and I lost my card in the first week of February, I still have not received the card. I called back again to express that I had lost my card and the customer service support line was confused and was not aware that I even called in the first place.

My BankAmericard cash back system offers different points for different purchases, and will change depending on how many you use. The AAA card does not have that issue. Plus along with my AAA membership, this card makes offers towards travel vouchers and I spent a lot of time traveling, so this maybe very useful if you travel a lot. But, with high variable rates, you have to be sure not to keep a balance, as much as possible with this card."

Also, getting $100 back just for spending $500 is great, I would have spent that much anyway.  The downsides of this card are that the foreign transaction fee is high.  3% is pretty high especially when it is usually free nowadays.  Also the late fee is a little steep at $35, people make mistakes and pay late sometimes, and $35 is a huge setback for something so small."

I pay my bills, groceries, and even go out shopping with it on occasions. It's slick design makes it cool to carry around in your wallet & it's mobile banking feature is excellent.

Some of the other cards go nuts with their interest rate. I did take a cash advance on this card as well,  it is high interest, but that is to be expected. I do not plan on getting another advance anytime soon. I do however plan to keep this card and to use continue using it for balance transfers when they offer a good rate."
2015-03-03,Sunil Sivaprasad,sunil.sivaprasad,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,Stay away from this card. Spirit mileage program is very bad. I used it for two years and they cancel your air miles suddenly. If you try to call spirit customer support they will cut throat to say there is nothing you can do get it back or will not explain the reason why they expired the miles. Also you don't earn miles and when you book the travel using these miles they now increased miles for travel and you need lot of mileages. I strongly advise to stay away from this card. This card is not worth it. Choosing 1 star since I cannot rate it 0.
2016-06-16,Gina Hall,gina_hall,False,,0,"I had a different experience.  My miles expired due to a snafu on my part (long story).  When I tried to get the miles back, I was told that I had to meet a certain spending requirement.  I met the requirement and I got the miles back.

They charged me the 35$ overdraft fee and then, to my surprise, said I had 5 days to bring the account current. Since I was on vacation this was quite a challenge. I asked a friend to make a counter deposit, which occurred n the 5th day. But I was STILL charged the 35 dollar EXTENDED overdraft fee, in addition to the other overdraft fee. I called the bank and they would not budge. I think that is poor customer service and I will always remember how the treated me, all for less then 5 dollars. I also posted this on the Bank of America Facebook Page."

They add up much slower than some other cards I have used. I also had a hard time using the points in the same way that they said I could when I signed up for the card.

I'm pretty sure that I am not being charged a fee, so I very much appreciate that. The only minor complaint I have is that I wish they had been more clear when I first opened the account about the limit on transfers out of savings each month, but my understanding is that the limit is actual a government rule, not an institutional rule, so I understand it is not their obligation. Overall, my experience with Bank of America has been positive."

It is the first one I opened on my own after moving to college away from my parents smaller city and thus away from their smaller bank. For the most part, I haven't had many issues with this Bank of America account. The customer service has been acceptable, and I feel my questions and concerns have been sufficiently dealt with. Until I turned 23, I did not have to pay any fees to maintain the account, which I very much appreciated. However, now that I am 23, I either have to maintain a 1500+ balance, have a 250+ direct deposit, or pay a 12 dollar monthly fee. While none of these are outrageous, it is my one qualm about the account. However, I remain loyal to the bank and have no plans to change. I very much appreciated the advance notice they provided about the switchover when I began being charged the monthly fee, and if I recall correctly, I believe they even waived the fee for a few months."

Their late fees are about average but they offer an extended grace period of 25 days! The cash advance interest rate is competitive with cards I have previously used at 24.99%. My last card was 36%.

I have been with them for 9 years and up until last year there was no ""maintenance fee"" on my account. So what has changed? Also I recently lost my debit card.

Everyone will be different in terms of things like past negatives and other various but over time,, if you manage credit wisely, this would really help to improve credit.  They are great for people with average credit in terms of own many cards you can get.  I hear they are good for people with bad credit with their secured card.  After using their cards to build my credit, I now have my pick of the excellent credit cards from American express to the Venture card.  I highly recommend them for average credit.  Their credit cards really helped me rebuild my credit.  As far as I know, I think they offer more cards for people with average credit than any other company."

I think that it’s great that you can earn 2 points per $1 for gas & grocery. These are the two primary reasons I use my credit card.  The 3 points per $1 on all qualifying AAA/ travel purchases are only beneficial if you travel and use AAA. I think the rewards offered are better than my current card (Chase Freedom Visa) which offers 5% cash back on categories that change every 3 months. I do not like how the categories change because they you will lose rewards for a few months.   This card offers better consistent rewards.

The first problem I had was with the application process. It took well over an hour to set up my checking and savings account. A second problem that I had is that my account had to be under my fathers. The bank told me that I would be charged a monthly fee for my account because I did not make enough money. As a student, working part time, I would be unable to keep up with the monthly minimums required to not result in a fee. I did not have a problem with my account being linked until I realized that my father had access to see everything that I purchased. However, I was forced to agree with this in order to open the account. I also tole the banker multiple times that if I did not have the funds I would like the card to be declined. However, I still got signed up for a program where the bank would take them from my savings. When I contacted customer service they told me that is what I signed up for. I know a lot of other people that have had problems with the customer service as well. This is not a bank that is looking to solve your problems. As a 25 year old independent woman I feel that I should be able to open a bank account without have fees charged and should be respected as my own customer. I am glad that I switched banks."

Every time that someone would transfer me money inside a banking institution, it would charge me $25, even if it was someone at Bank of America. I was never told this when I first opened my account, which frustrated me even more. After a couple of times of this happening I went into a local Bank of America and discussed what could be done about this, and they ended up refunding me the amount of money that had been charged in fees to transfer the funds. I had an online and ATM type account at the time, they then set me up with a basic checking account so I would not incur these fees anymore. They were helpful in fixing the problem, I just wished I had been informed when I first opened the account about this particular fee."
2015-02-12,aryn Forman,arynaf,False,Bank of America Checking,3,I had a frustrating experience trying to replace checks. They would not provide free checks but wanted over 25 dollars for them even though I hadn't replaced them in years. They are also not honest about their fees which is very frustrating. I never know what is needed to ensure I do not receive any charges with my account. I cannot trust them as a company and only keep them because of the convenient ATMS.

After all the monthly fees and surcharges I felt like I was being nickle and dimed every month. I had no major problems with the account, but Bank of americas customer service is horrible. So I eventually moved my funds to a credit union and I really couldn't be happier. No more fees and random problems. The savings account wasn't bad, except for the fees that is. But I really didn't want to have to deal with bank of americas horrible customer service. So I didn't bother staying with them."

I regret that decision. I had some many problems with them. I once was charged incorrectly on my billing statement and I had a very hard time getting it reversed. Not to mention the unnecessary monthly fees and such. I switched to a credit union and couldn't be happier.
2015-02-12,Ian Goodwin,ipg123,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"Bank of America has a solid checking account. I recently added an account with them in order to gain access to a Bank of America Credit Card. Their checking account is a little bit more stringent than others, but is absolutely manageable. In order to have your monthly fee waived, you need to keep an average of $1500 in you account or have at least $250 directly deposited into the account each month. As compared to PNC (my other checking account), these requisites are more strict and held to a higher standard. All-in-all, I am happy that I chose Bank of America."

I really have a problem with the fee for the overdraft charges.  God help you if a check does not clear for whatever reason...I am talking, of course, not about the checks YOU write but a check given to you as a payment.  If that does not clear and as a result, your checks do not clear - this being, in my view, NO fault of your own - then they are more than happy to charge you $35 per overdraft.  In all other respects, this bank is only average.  Average customer service.  Average products.  I would, and did, put my money elsewhere."

It was amazing how well the customer service is with them. The check depositing with mobile scanner is hassle free, so is the money transfer from other country and to other countries. Thinking of even starting a savings account with them. Hope fully they will continue the same customer support they are providing now."

While I've only had it for about a year, I can honestly say I'm happier with Bank of America than I have been with any of my previous banks. Also, when first contacting Bank of America about opening this account, they were extremely friendly and explained exactly what I was getting with this account, which was a plus."

Was approved no problem and wasn't bumped to another card. You do have to have a moderate income and credit rating but for a card with those kind of awesome benefits, that's to be expected. I have yet to use the miles or anything like that but based on the companion fare ALONE, this card will be worth it!"

2015-02-02,Kristy khalid,kristykhalid,False,Bank of America Checking,5,What really turned my eye to Bank of America for a checking account is that they offered payment reminders and alerts that I could set up for my own needs.  I find being able to work with my checking account via my cell and being able to receive text information from them a real bonus.  I'm not always able to get down to a branch and I'm not always near a laptop or computer.  Knowing I can access my checking account via my phone is a huge relief.  Most banks already have it so that you can set up your checking account to pay this or that bill.  I didn't like that too much because it was always too easy to forget about having paid XX bill and then using my debit card and becoming overdrawn.  I don't have to worry about that anymore since they have those payment reminders.  I'm so glad for those!

I mainly use this card for gifts or beauty products but it is not just limited to that!

You will only receive the advertised bonus miles if you are approved for a fairly high credit limit that earns you ""visa signature status"". And a high credit score alone is not adequate to get to that status. They do not have a system in place that extends you a counter-offer if you are not approved for signature. You will simply receive a lesser card in the mail and you are stuck with it. Even if they are able to approve you for a higher limit and upgrade to signature after the fact, you still will not get any of the bonus miles advertised in their offer. Without the bonus miles and signature benefits, the Alaska Bank of America cards are really not worth the fees."

I deposited the check and waited the time period for the hold which was five business days.  But on the 12th business days the bank withdrew the amount that the deposited check was for saying that the check I deposited had bounced.  Now, yes, it did apparently bounce but I did not understand why it took so long and by the time they reversed the deposit I had written checks of my own out against it.  I feel they should have contacted me much earlier because they had to know much earlier that the deposit did not go through.  When I called and asked them why it took so long, the answer I got was, ""well sometimes it takes us longer to do something about it"".  Really, that is not a good answer."

In fact, they are reasonably quick with all transfers. Most gas stations have bank of america accepted ATMs, so the annoying $2.50 fee does not effect me at all which is nice."
2015-01-08,Thomas Santell,dottommytm,False,,4,I have had Bank Of America for about 2 years now. I signed up because it was a bank that was local to my area. When I went in to sign up the application process was pretty simple. The staff was nice and helpful to me. I got a student account with them because I was in school at the time. This offered a few added benefits. The bank offers reasonable hours and the ATM is always available outside the bank. I would recommend this bank to those in the area.

Few times when I found out there were incorrect charges on my account, they resolved the problem through call. A very good checking account and in comparison to other banks I have found BOFA provides low fees and low over draft fee. The balance requirement is also low in comparison to other banks."

All the rest are just the lowest quality. I had to wait for an hour to see a banker. While the banker was constantly helping customers, I saw three guys just walking in the lobby checking in a few customers. The checking account is ridiculous. If you are not careful, you will see fees on your account. You cann't find a free account at all at this bank and it changes its rules on how to avoid a fee all the time."
2015-01-06,James Alston,jamesa1,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,1,This account does what it is supposed to do but I did not like the fees. $5 a month for this service is too much for what it offers. You can do this on your own by transferring a set amount every money manually to a savings account. I would not recommend this and I quit using it when I had it. The interest rate is low and I can’t economically understand why the fee is so high.

I generally appreciate their customer service. I've over drafted a few times and about half the time, they'll help me out by waiving a few of the fees, so that's nice, not a lot of banks will do that for you. I did have trouble with a representative at one point who wasn't honest about a fee that I was incurring. I thought that I could set up overdraft protection for free and it would automatically draw from savings if I didn't have the funds. The rep made it sound like this was free, when it really wasn't. A good account overall though! I would recommend this checking account service, but like anything, read the fine print!"

I decided to go with Bank of America and I was at first rather pleased with the bank. The most appealing features that this bank offered to me, at the time, were low to no monthly fees depending upon my balance, and the option to enroll in their 'Keep the Change' program. The 'Keep the Change' program helped me save a little extra each month by rounding up any purchases I made using my debit card to the nearest dollar and depositing that money into my savings account each month. What was even better, was that for the first year they matched the amount each month! After graduating from college, when the low monthly fees disappeared I decided to close my savings account with Bank of America. If you are a student, or already have a checking or credit card account with Bank of America, this is a great savings account, but if you are not, there are certainly better options available elsewhere."

I appreciate the low fees and the fairly low over draft fees as compared to other banks. I really do NOT like the fact that the balance requirements are so high- maintaining upwards of 10k in a checking account is kind of unreasonable. But the fee per month is only 25, so it's not a huge problem. Customer service at BOA is kind of awful though. Overall there are a lot of better accounts in this range I'd recommend before this one."

The best part is for the first 3 months they will double what ever Keep The Change transactions you make up to a certain limit. It's a very helpful way to stack up those cents, you'll be surprised at how well it works,"

Fortunately, we haven't had to charge to this card much but it's been there if we needed it. Additionally, they have some awesome customer service so don’t be afraid to call.

There are aspects of my Bank of America experiences that have been very negative but out of all of them, the savings account has caused the least amount of headaches. I love that I get Keep The Change money put in there with each transaction. That money accrues quickly and I love that extra source of cash flow. There is one thing to look out for though that I just recently found out about. There is a certain type of savings account that charges you $12 monthly for having a balance lower than $1000. I cannot imagine how many times I was charged this fee, unaware that this stipulation was on my savings account (yes I now pay closer attention to my banking than I have in the past). When I brought up the charges with Bank of America they changed my account to the regular one. I don't know why that account stipulation even exists on a checking account?? There is literally no other difference between that type of account and the regular no-limit savings account. I just wanted to give a heads up about this to anyone who maybe doesn't pay super close attention to their account."

The massive amount of hidden fees pile on. They are so quick to tack on transfer fees and the fact that they call it a fee ""for doing the transfer work for you"" is beyond obnoxious considering it takes about two keystrokes to transfer money from one account to the other.

This bank is great about protecting its customers from fraud, but I do wish that the monthly fees were smaller. One thing that is really annoying is that they seem to keep an eye on your balance, and if it falls low, they will wait until it is CERTAIN that a new charge will put you in the red so that you have to pay them overdraft fees. It's frustrating because unless I take a screenshot of my account every single day, I am not able to prove that they do this. By the time I get the notification that I'm being charged an overdraft fee, my account statement no longer looks the way it did before, it pushes everything up so that my balance gets dramatically smaller and then goes in the red. I'm thankful for this bank for the way they've handled my debit card info being stolen, but I feel like I've racked up what they saved me just by paying them overdraft fees later."

The only bad experience I had with BOA, which ultimately led to closing my account, was how long it took for them to correct their mistake on a check I had deposited that I needed to pay my rent. Due to a technical problem with their machine, my check deposit was delayed, despite having my receipt from the deposit. I ended up with a late fee for my rent payment. After contacting customer service, there was no resolution."

While there is a monthly fee, it is easily avoided if you have direct deposit set up for your salary. You can also link it to a BofA savings account, and set it to automatically take out savings deposits. This includes Keep the Change, an optional program that takes the extra cents off every debit card purchase and puts it in your savings account. Additionally, you can set up Bill Pay through the checking account, which is very convenient.The customer service for the account has been awesome, too -- typically a quick response, and they have even forgiven an overdraft fee once or twice. I'm very happy with this account.I do wish there was a way to avoid the foreign fees, such as ATM and transactions while abroad. I travel a decent amount, and I end up trying to get cash to avoid most of these fees. BofA does allow you to withdraw cash for no fee if you go to specific banks like Barclays or Deutsche Bank."

If you get this card, I recommend depositing your cash back rewards directly into another Bank of America account (checking or savings), because it gives you 10% extra if you do that. Applying it to the credit card statement balance is not as good. There is no annual fee, which is great. I've had cards with much worse rewards that charged me an annual fee.

It saved countless trips to the drive thru window.  There were no fees, and the ATM fees were competitive with other local banks.  The only issue I had was locating Bank of America ATMs.  If I lived in a bigger city, I don't see this being an issue.

At first we were mainly interested just in the perks of getting the extra bonus sign-up miles, but after our first statement we realized that getting 2 miles for every dollar spent was an excellent perk!

Like I said, poor customer service. The checking account works fine for it's intents and purposes, but I don't trust them enough to leave large sums of money in there. I use other banks for my everyday use checking accounts and only keep my Bank of America because it is not worth the time to close it."

2014-12-01,colleen,clong1327,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,2,"The AAA member Rewards Credit Card is an alright card.  It is nothing special really.  It has rewards that are AAA related such as car repairs and vouchers good for travel, but it also rewards you with a point system that gives you 2 points per $1 on gas, groceries and drug store purchases.  This is a pretty decent amount of rewards for one card and it is especially beneficial to me because I travel by car a lot.  Unfortunately, this card does have many drawbacks.  For example, the interest rate on this card is a lot higher than a lot of similar cards I looked up. I have also had a couple issues with their customer service department when I tried to call in and dispute a couple of late charges.  Their staff was pretty rude to me. Overall, I like this card because it gives me a lot of rewards so I am not going to cancel it, but I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone either."

Getting 2% and 3% back on grocery and gas purchases is nice and the $100 bonus is really a good reason to get this card. It's also really nice that this card does not charge an annual fee and it gives you a generous 25 day grace period, and with the built in smart chip, there is always a peace of mind when you use this card."

I have it linked up with the savings account and find it very easy to manage. I refuse to pay yearly fees! The online access is easy and excellent. I also like the Online  BillPay feature and mobile app, which allows you to make payments in any amount to any of your bills for free. This is great, as I was once paying a large bill in small amounts and it was fun to “chip away” at my balance in small increments. I happened to get “skimmed” a few times, and Bank of America quickly replaced the stolen money from my checking account with no questions asked, as they continued their investigation. It has been a great experience having a checking account with Bank of America!"

Zero foreign transaction fees, a very competitive interest rate, and lucrative reward points make for a great card.Compare this to the Capital One Quicksilver which has a higher permanent rate, not nearly as many rewards, and foreign transaction fees.If you're going to be travelling, you can't do better than the Bank Americard Travel Rewards Credit Card."
2014-11-22,Bonnie Blackman,bonnie.blackman.71,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,1,This card is terrible.  I called over 1 year ago to ask that my mom not be charged for an AAA membership since she wasn't driving any longer.  They said no problem.  Of course when it came time to renew they did it automatically.  When I called to have it rescinded they said they couldn't do that unless they got the card back.  That is BS since I am a member of AAA and they bill me annually.  I can choose to renew or not and no one asks for the card back.  We sent the card back over 2 months ago and they still haven't credited her account.  Well my mom died 2 weeks ago and I wanted to pay the card but not until the credit was on there.  They asked me 20 questions and finally I said look either give me the credit or I am not paying the bill and you can sue a dead person.  They got a supervisor on the phone who said that the deceased department would have to call me back.  I said no now or never and they said later.  So screw you AAA eat the whole damn bill and sue a dead person.  If you can avoid this card by all means do so.  Automatically charging for the membership should not be a requirement.  Worst card ever.
2014-11-20,Topanga Elliott,topanga.elliott.7,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,4,"This card is really nice. I like it a lot and know someone else who uses it too. Few credit cards are so flexible with their reward points. Its reward system that allows cash the flexibility of cash back is similar to my Chase Freedom card, I can use my rewards for cash or gift cards. The AAA Members Reward Credit Card looks promising, especially to those traveling outside of the country with its acceptance in 130 countries! Not many cards boast of that attribute. All in all it is a decent card."

However, I do remain with them for one of my savings accounts. I like their “Keep the Change” feature that automatically transfers money to your savings account. Over time, this little bit of change adds up and it is a nice little treat to see extra funds in your savings. Also, their rates on savings accounts is one of the best I have come across, and I can say this because we have 3 savings accounts with other banks."

Although I usually prefer small banks, I have been impressed with Bank of America. When I was trying to get a loan from them, I was able to meet with someone in the bank, and he was very honest about the situation. I was impressed with his customer service. It is very easy to access my account online and review charges. Compared to other banks I have used, their online services are easy to understand. I can view photo images of every check that I deposit. It is nice to be able to access a Bank of America ATM wherever I go"
2014-11-17,Sarah,Switcherbear,False,Bank of America Checking,2,"I have mixed feeling about the Bank of American Core checking account. I've had one for years with few issues, and as a student I appreciated the low monthly fee and the fact that my age allowed me to avoid paying any extra fees. However, I did find it annoying that after I turned 24, my monthly balance had to be 1500 dollars in order to avoid being hit with recurring fees. The over draft charges were crazy as well. Now that I'm older the account is pretty much a dud. I barely use it because I don't want to be slammed with fees. The lack of interest on the account also makes it less than great when you look at other banks. Also, this is worth mentioning- their customer service is HORRIBLE. On the few instances where I had issues with my account, they were rude and unhelpful. Overall I guess the account is OK if you're young, but for an adult over 23 it's just a pain."

I have had nothing but problems with Bank of America and their fees are astounding. Their customer service, at least that of the branch I visit the most, is poor, the tellers act as if they are annoyed if you do business with them. I love the versatility of online banking, but sometimes I have to do business with the cashiers to deposit and transfer money or get cashiers checks and between the customer service and the price for certain transactions I have chosen to switch banks as soon as I can."

We did have a mortgage through them and in return had free checking and free savings, however we sold our home last summer and no longer get free checking and are paying $25 a month for a checking account and another $8 a month for our other account. We will be closing the more costly account soon and open an account with a Credit Union that offers free checking.

While I am not a big fan of how Bank of America handles their checking, I do love my savings account. Since it is directly linked to my checking, I can easily transfer funds from my checking to my savings online. My favorite feature of my account, however, is the fact that whenever I make a debit card purchase, the change is transferred into my savings. So if I buy something with my card for 18.48, 52 cents is placed into my savings from my checking. It's a great little way to slowly add to your account. The only thing I would change is the interest rate."

I made this my major bank account because we did not have Wells Fargo in the area. I do love this bank because it has a very functional online banking site and an abundance of bank and atm locations throughout my area and most of where I travel. However, even when I was a student they did not offer me free checking. I had to (and still do) perform all my banking online and via the ATM. If I use the tellers inside the bank, I am charged a monthly fee of about $10. For this reason, I have a new bank and use this as a secondary account."

2014-11-07,p sellers,psellers,False,Bank of America Checking,3,Bank of America's checking  account is a pretty good banking option.  You can make deposits from a cell phone or at ATM machine. The only issues I have is that the branch managers don't have much authority if you have a problem that needs resolution. I also don’t like how banks are so open in that when discussing your personal information everyone can hear. Additionally having to enter a long account number on their automated system for my balance is pretty inconvenient.
2014-11-07,Jared,jtr12,False,Bank of America Checking,3,"It's ok.  Service at my local branch isn't the greatest, and after the ATM almost cost me a deposit I go inside to do all my banking now, which makes the less than stellar service ever less appealing.  As for the actual account, it does everything I need it to do. Money goes in, money goes out. It does a brilliant job of that.  If your local branch has some competent people at it it would be a fine account.  But keep looking if your branch doesn't have decent people/service at it.  There are plenty of other banks with comparable  accounts, so I think the service you get at each of your local banks would be a big factor here."

I like that you can use it for not only planes and hotels but cruises(which is not something you see everyday). I can see that it sucks you can't translate the rewards to cash but I would rather travel to be completely honest.

There are some good things I do like and I will list those first, the online and iPhone interfaces are great and secure, and the web app is too, the money transfers are fast when going IN to the account, and even faster coming out and that leads me to my issues. The fees. The fees that bank of America charges are insane. 15.00 out of a money transfer regardless of amt, 12 dollar monthly service fee, overage fees, 'maintenance' fees... WHAT?!

Another thing that I don't like is that in my area all of the atm machines are drive up only with a machine just sitting in the middle of the parking lot on a cement island. This does not seem safe at all, and I even had my bank card skimmed which I think may have a lot to do with the way the atm machine is set up."

HOWEVER- IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH OVERDRAFTING BEWARE. Bank of america doesn't offer overdrafting forgiveness, and if you let the overdrafting go they continue to charge you extended overdraft fees which are over $30 each time.

They are a major bank, so I never had to worry about fraud, etc.However, twice while traveling I called and gave them a heads up that I would be in other states, etc, so that my debit card/ checking account would not have a hold put on it. Of course both times, my debit card had a hold on it. This wouldn't have been a huge deal, except one of the times, I was in Las Vegas and it was Saturday of memorial day weekend, so I literally had to borrow cash from a friend to get me to Tuesday. I then had to take a cab to the off strip BoA location, which probably cost me 60-80$ round trip. The fact that this happened a few weeks later in Seattle was ridiculous.They also have charged me some ridiculous service fees at times, which is why I plan to leave BoA at some point.

As my bills came in at 5 pm and my check came in at midnight. After much fussing and gnashing of teeth, they let me speak to a supervisor who refunded a full year of over draft charges and promised this problem would be taken care of.

It's the small things the BoA offers that I really like, such as being able to transfer money to friends and family through their app, and being able to deposit checks by taking a picture on my phone.

Definitely the best banking experience I've had so far, and it's accessible to me even while traveling. I massively prefer the online chat feature to get immediate assistance with whatever questions I have, as opposed to calling in, working through the automated menu, and being stuck on hold for what feels like forever before getting the exact same service.

I have had this account for over 10 years and I can't stand the fact that they rearrange your transactions so that you have more potential to overdraw your account. This has happened on several occasions and each time that I call to complain, I do not get my issue resolved. This has been a very frustrating experience to say the least."
2014-10-08,Ashley Lockwood,ashleynikole,False,Bank of America Checking,3,"I have had this checking account for over ten years; I do not have any complaints about it other than the fact that there is no interest offered.  Bank of America doesn't charge any fees for me since I have direct deposit with them, and I'd rather have no-fee than an account that offers interest.  Ideally they would offer a zero fee interest checking account (I'm not sure if any banks offer that currently)...but for now this account is ok for me."
2014-10-08,Ashley Lockwood,ashleynikole,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,2,"I'm not sure I would recommend the Bank of America Savings Account to people who are looking for a new savings account.  I've had my account for about ten years (just out of convenience, because I also have a checking account at BofA) and have considered switching to a bank that offers interest and low/no fees.  The only Pro of having this account would be pure convenience for me. Cons would be that it doesn't have competitive interest rates, and the bank charges a fee for a certain number of withdrawals per month."
2014-10-06,Terence Pan,azuredragoon,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"This card is pretty good, It gives 2% back on grocery stores and 3% on case for the first $1500 combined purchases of those two every quarter. There is no way I would spend more than that on those two items every month. This is stuff I would normally have to buy for my day to day needs and it is nice to get good rewards from it. The $100 reward for $500 in purchases in the first 90 days is pretty neat as well. There is no other rewards on the other hand, just the usual 1% on everything else. I like how it gives an extra bonus to be redeemed into a BofA account."
2014-09-30,Dee De La Rosa,dddebj,False,Bank of America Checking,2,"I have done business with Bank of America for years, and had boasted about it regularly but, six years ago, I closed my account. The service had deteriorated, and my balances were affected by their change of policies. They were not knowledgeable in the products that inquired about, and were unable to answer my questions regarding my existing account. They responded with apathy. This, and their lack of attentiveness lead me to believe that they did not care, and I was possibly right about my concerns that they were making accounting mistakes. What was interesting is that I experienced almost the same level of customer service across the board. Like I said, that was six years ago. Maybe they've changed but, I would definitely test their customer service quality because I've learned that there comes a time when it really does matter."
2014-09-26,Billy Martin,darthbill1978,False,Bank of America Checking,5,"I recently opened a Bank of America checking account. Everything was going fine with it until i checked my balance last week and i was charged $35 for being 3 cents over drawn in my account. I had used my check card at Redbox and somehow it made it go into the negative 3 cents. I called the Bank of America customer service and explained the situation, they were very nice and friendly and right away refunded the $35 fee they had charged for being overdrawn. The girl on the phone had a bit of a laugh they they did that over 3 cents. Great customer service on there part and i was very please i was able to resolve this issue without much effort."
2014-09-25,Brian Ackroyd,brian_ackroyd_3,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,4,"I have had several accounts with Bank of America for quite a few years now (checking and credit card), and I recently added a savings account.  I couldn't be happier.  The fees are inexpensive to non-existent.  If you keep a minimum balance of $300 in your savings account, they waive the monthly fee.  They have also been very easy to work with and they have a great online platform.  I hardly ever have to go into a branch because I can do everything online or in my phone."
2014-09-25,j d,blackadder,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"My account became a BoA account when they bought out my bank years ago, so I didn't really choose them.  I would say the only thing I enjoy about this account is that BoA has many ATM locations which make withdrawals and deposits easy.However, there are still occasional issues with the fact that I opened my account in one state and now live in another.  BoA keeps saying that they are trying to integrate systems which will end these issues but it never happens.  It's not a big issue, the problems rarely crop up, but solving their ""integration issue"" doesn't seem to be a priority, despite what I have been told.  As a premium account holder I have also tried to have legal documents notarized there once - but they insisted on charging a fee, whereas other banks do that for no cost.  It just seemed a typical practice of ""fee creep"" that seems to be rampant at BoA (and other banks to be fair) since 2008.  Considering their part in the mortgage scandal and recent huge government fines related to that I mostly feel I should move my money elsewhere.  I get a bad vibe about their ethics."
2014-09-25,Cassie Miller,cassie_miller_9678,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,5,"I recently opened a Bank of America account after receiving a credit card from this bank and enjoying their rewards program. What I liked about the savings account is that you do not get charged monthly if you have the three hundred balance in the account at all times, which I usually do. Also I enjoy I am able to link my accounts online so I can see the activity in all my bank of America accounts at once. The people have been very friendly and worked with me right away."
2014-09-25,Abbey Dennis,abbaenvy,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"I was a Bank of America checking account customer for several years. I initially opened an account with them because it was who my employer banked with and it convent. The initial process of opening the account was easy. They even urged me to open a second checking account and convinced me with would also be free with added perks. I had no need for this account, but agreed for the perks. At this time charged started racking up on my first account. This went on for several months, I tried over and over again to get a clear answer from customer service and everyone gave me a different reason. When I was finally fed up and tried to close my account, they gave me issue with that as well. I encountered bad customer service and hidden fees. I will never bank with them again!"
2014-09-25,Tina Tucker,tuckertl,False,Bank of America Checking,5,"I love my Bank of America checking account.  They have really great customer service.  It was very easy to sign up for - all I had to do was fill out an application online.  I received all of my information (account number and routing number) and debit card less than a week later.  My wire transfers only take a couple of days, much better than my old bank.  Banking online is really convenient."
2014-09-22,Sergio,sag91,False,Bank of America Checking,1,I've had this checking account for about 5 years now. It started off as a student checking account and then after some time it transformed to this one here. It does what I need it to do. If I ever have a problem come up it's usually nothing that doesn't take more than a phone call to fix. Problem is that it can take between 15-20 minutes to get someone on the phone. I've had a few problems avoiding the maintenance fees. I'll never understand why I have to pay someone to hold MY money. Not to mention that BofA likes to list your withdrawals not in the order they receive them but by deducting the largest ones first thereby maximizing the overdraft fees that can occur. I can't wait to take my business elsewhere.

For me, at the end of the day, it's all about customer service.  Bank of America's customer is second to none.  Everytime something comes up such as fraud comes up (rarely) it is fixed no questions asked andthe money is put back into my account the same day.  I have never had to wait while they investigate.  Everyone in the branches is always very nice and friendly.  I would recommend (and I do) Bank or Amrican to anyone."
2014-09-22,Greg,avoncacg,False,Bank of America Checking,5,I have had a bank of america account for over five years now. Bank of Americas customer service has always been second to none in my opinion and anytime i have encountered a problem i was treated as a valuable customer. I had a problem with my checking account about a year ago after i had lost my wallet. I figured i had left it around the house somewhere as i often have however when i saw multiple transactions posted to my account online i realized this was not the case. I called customer service fraud department and they assisted me in cancelling my card and recouping my lost funds with ease. It was an overall pleasant process considering and i will continue to be a loyal Bank of America customer for the foreseeable future.
2014-09-22,Jack,jack024,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,I used my Bank of America credit card at a restaurant and after checking my account online I noticed that the charge was significantly higher than it should have been. I called Bank of America and the customer service rep called the restaurant with me on the line. The customer service rep had the restaurant change the amount charged to me and let me know that if I had any other problems to call back and they would be taken care of.
2014-09-19,Deserae Leach,deserae_leach,False,Bank of America Checking,2,"I had an account with BOA years ago.  When I first started with them everything was perfect.  However after a few years, I began to notice they would approved the big transactions first even when smaller transactions were made before the larger ones.  This incurred overdraft fees well over $400.  Needless to say after it was over and done I decided to switch banks.  The one this I did like about them is the ease of getting everything situated out."
2014-09-19,Lindsay Marie,lindsaympayne,False,Bank of America Savings & CDs,4,"I don't have many complaints about my Bank of America savings account.  The account is very basic with no ways to earn points or rewards of any kind.  However, if you are linked up with a checking account you can earn cash back offers which is beneficial.  With Bank of America, they have a 0% liability policy.  So, if you call and report that there has been fraudulent activity on your account, they are usually pretty good about taking off the charges immediately.  I've never had any problems with this whereas with banks in the past this has been an issue.  Overall, I don't have any complaints.  This savings account does it's job and I'm happy with its simplicity."
2014-09-19,joe,toolman,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"I just recently opened a checking account with Bank of America for small business purpose. The customer service, as well as the application process, was great. I discussed my goals, activity, as well as business purpose with the bank's employee, and I felt that BoA would be a good choice. I have a number of other bank accounts for various purposes, and so far feel that BoA matches up very well. In terms of disclosures,I felt that there was some confusion at times, but due to a helpful staff, and seemingly proper conflict resolution, my doubts were set to ease. Also, BoA is very prominent in my area with his helpful for both my business, as well as my employees. Overall, I would recommend BoA,"
2014-09-18,Kennady Collins,kennady_collins_5,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,4,"I've had this card for a few years, and I'm not completely sure how to feel about it. While this is the main card I use, I don't necessarily feel as though there needs to be the huge yearly fee that is charged. I'll admit, I've had to max out my time in their grace period more times than I'd like, which was a good feature for me to have. I would recommend this card to someone who doesn't mind paying the large annual fee."
2014-09-18,Brian Ackroyd,brian_ackroyd_3,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"I couldn't be more happy with this card.  It has become my favorite.  People complain about the high annual fee, but it is well worth, and inexpensive compared to American Express.  The rewards are great, and multiply fast.  My favorite part is the companion ticket I get every year.  It makes our flights for our annual trip much more inexpensive and allows us to spend the money on other parts of our trips!"
2014-09-17,Amy,sunflowerladi,False,Bank of America Checking,4,I have been with Bank of America for almost 10 years now and have not experienced any issues with them.  Since opening the account the customer service reps have been very helpful and accommodating to any requests I have had.  Every time I have gone into the bank with a question they have always been very helpful and quick with responses.  I would recommend them as a bank to anyone who is looking for a bank account that doesn't hit you with a lot of fees all the time.
2014-09-15,Donald Pinckney,engadget_hd,False,Bank of America Checking,1,"The interest rate Bank of America offers on their checking accounts is about as low you can find. They literally offer .03 percent on the almost 20,000 dollars that I keep with Bank of America. Most other banks would offer 20 times this rate. The money market accounts are almost as bad and just make it harder to make large transfers. I would recommend banking else where if it is at all possible."
2014-09-12,Sam Braden,nickbrayy4,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"Earning cash back on all purchases is simply the greatest point any card company can make when trying to recruit new customers. When I learned that that was the case, I signed up right away and started using my card. Needless to say; I charge everything to this card and have not had any problems for over two years. I pay off the balance every single month and do not carry over any balances. Very good card if you need something simple, easy, straightforward, and the rewards are just a great perk!"
2014-09-11,Jade Preis,jade_m_preis,False,Bank of America Checking,2,"I have been with Bank of America for over 10 years and have rather mixed feelings about them. I really like the mobile banking app and the fact that BOA has locations just about everywhere you go. I don't like that I have to pay $5 a month for a savings account that doesn't even bear interest. I really don't like when they hold back large checks for two weeks because they need to ""wait for them to go through the clearing house."" As someone in the finance industry, I know that this process can be completed in literally seconds. BOA has never been able to explain to me why their process takes two weeks. I am in the process of switching banks as we speak."
2014-09-10,Brian Clark Ignacio,brianclark.ignacio,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"I recently applied for a BOA core checking account. Applying for an account was fast and easy. I received my checking account number within a week, and a few days to joint my amazon payments account with this. Customer service was friendly and helpful. I haven't received my ATM card since applying, and I called to find out that Bank Of America somehow never ordered me an ATM, so by asking me all these questions, which some were private, manage to confirm some extra informations they needed in order for them to order me one. Despite this account having a fairly huge monthly fee, it shouldn't be a problem as long as I have money coming in regularly. So far so good with this company."
2014-09-10,TaQuanyia,tls43,False,Bank of America Checking,3,"Well originally I had the campus edge checking which they automatically switched to this one. It is 12 dollars a month if you don't have a balance of 1,000 dollars or a direct deposit. I was fine with that because I wasn't getting a monthly fee when I was working, now that I am not 12 is a bit much for a checking account especially when other banks and credit unions have completely free accounts. BOA has been my bank since I opened a checking account, their customer service is great for the most part except when I had someone from India trying to help me. I do think BOA is trying to make it whereas people who don't have a lot of money find another bank. However, I do like all the ways you can interact with the bank without actually having to go to the bank. I like to get my receipts e-mailed to me to save paper and load it into an excel sheets to keep track of it."

In addition to the $100 bonus for spending $500 in the first 90 days. I also love the 1, 2, and 3% rewards all the time and the no interest of the first year. I look forward to using BankAmericard for most of all of my future purchases and redeeming rewards at the end of the year for Christmas gifts! Its definitely a card I would recommend to my friends and family!"
2014-09-09,Alia Bierwag,aliaghoul,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"The AAA Member Rewards Credit Card seems like a good credit card. I normally dislike point based rewards, because I have a Capital One credit card and reward points are definitely not worth it. But getting extra points on groceries and gas is an appealing offer. This card also seems unique in that you can get exclusive AAA rewards such as travel and car repairs. Having money or credit that you can use for car repairs is always a good thing, because you never know when you might need it! If it was a card I used often, and was able to redeem the AAA vouchers, it would feel like a nice safety net in case of emergencies."
2014-09-09,Alia Bierwag,aliaghoul,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"I wish the credit cards I have had the perks of this one. Right now I have a Capital One card and I only get Reward Points, which aren't useful for anything. The $100 bonus cash and cash back on purchases (especially the groceries one) on the BankAmericard seem very rewarding. The interest rate after 1 year seems fair and similar to most credit cards. Overdraft protection is always a good thing as well. If I'm ever in the market for another credit card, I will definitely consider this one. My only downside is I don't have a Bank of America bank account to receive the cash back, but using it as a statement credit would be useful as well."
2014-09-08,Melissa Goodnight,mrsgoodnight,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"We have been with BOA for over ten years. We started out with student accounts when we were in college and we our now enrolled in the MyAccess Checking. The number one thing that I LOVE about BOA is the mobile banking. We don't deal with a lot of checks anymore, as we have money directly deposited, but we occasionally get them and we don't even have to go to a bank. Not that there isn't a bank anywhere we go! We live in Charlotte, NC and there are BOA's everywhere, but we don't even have the hassle of driving up to the teller anymore. We just scan the deposits from our iPhone and the money is deposited. Way to go BOA, you have always been upfront with the technology. The only reason I gave 4-Stars is because sometimes when I have had to call the customer service number I have got a few different responses or felt like the people I talked to couldn't always answer my questions. But that is few and far between!"
2014-09-08,Daniel,DanielRameriz,False,,2,"Bank of America to me has always been kind of a stuck up bank. They charge high fees and high overdraft fees. They are able to do this because they are one of the top banks in the game. I left this bank years ago because they seem to make up policies as they go, i have never been able to resolve a issue with them in a way i saw as fair to me. The only plus is that they have locations everywhere but i rather pay the ATM fee of using another bank than bank with these guys again."
2014-09-08,Daniel,DanielRameriz,False,Bank of America Checking,2,"The fees on The Bank of America MyAccess checking account are pretty high, with a high threshold to avoid the $12 monthly fee. I had this account a few years ago and did not keep it long. The overdraft charges are piled on  and i once received 3 overdrafts for a charge that was broken up into separate payments by them. The only positive is they have locations everywhere near me but the fees got to be too much."
2014-09-08,Jill G,lambchop522,False,Bank of America Checking,2,"I used this checking account only for a short time because I found that the monthly fee was extremely high, and the minimum balance requirement to avoid the monthly fee was too high for me as well. I was just out of college at the time and working at a low paying job. Although I like the Bank of America credit card that I used several years later very much, the checking account was just not the right match for me at the time. I should have taken more time to find a suitable checking account, and I believe the representative who assisted me did not have my best interests at heart as well. Years later when I had a better job this might have been a suitable card for me."
2014-09-04,McKenzie Thompson,mckenzie_thompson_9,False,Bank of America Credit Cards,5,"This has been a good card for me, although the customer service which comes with it has by far been what sets it apart from my other cards/experiences. It takes awhile to rack up enough points for rewards to kick in, but travel rewards are only one vein of rewards available with this card, so I can't complain."
2014-09-03,Laurel Stuart,laurel_artemis_stuart,False,Bank of America Checking,4,"I have been a Bank of America checking customer for over twelve years. There have been some hick-ups along the way but the majority of my experiences with their customer service department itself has been excellent.  Most recently, I had a $20 check overdraft by .25 because of the ""Keep The Change"" program deducting money from my account and me not realizing it. While the CSR I spoke to on the phone could not remove the $35 overdraft fee, I felt like I had her sympathy and even if I walked away disappointed, I was at least able to resolve the underlying problem and get ""Keep The Change"" removed so it never happened again."

They are attentive to my banking needs , no hidden costs, and in the event that I ever do end up needing something they immediately handle everything with excellent customer service over all I have no complaints."
2014-09-02,Jessica West,cherieish,False,Bank of America Checking,3,"I've had my checking account for about five years now and although it is slightly better than other accounts I've had, it's still a typical bank. Their method for dealing with fraud charges is ridiculous and almost impossible to win. Also constantly have new debit cards sent because the old ones are compromised, which is irritating. Overdraft fees are about the same as other banks ($35). Customer service is average. I like that I can deposit checks from my phone and ATMs are prevalent."
